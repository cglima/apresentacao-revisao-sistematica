AB  -  It is well established that numerous errors, biases and omissions in recording blood pressure exist. This study had two objectives. Firstly, to measure the accuracy of sphygmomanometers used in general practice and secondly to assess digit bias in blood pressure recording. This study was carried out in the then Northfield PCG, which comprised 18 practices and 67 GPs. A total of 131 mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometers were tested for accuracy by a trained technician in accordance with the methods specified in BS 2743 (1990). Accuracy was defined as an error of greater than 10 mm Hg. The second part of the methodology involved undertaking an audit of the proportion of registered patients aged 35‐80 years who had their blood pressure measured within the last 5 years by members of the Primary Health Care Team. The results were that of the mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometers tested, 17% were inaccurate. Of these, 4% recorded an error greater than 10 mm Hg. One percent of mercury and 10% of aneroid sphygmomanometers recorded an error greater than 10 mm Hg respectively. Sixteen (12%) sphygmomanometers were so deteriorated (air leaks, dirt in mercury) that the researcher suggested their immediate withdrawal from service. The results of the blood pressure recording audit suggested digit bias of both systolic and diastolic recordings to the nearest 10 mm Hg. This study suggests that sphygmomanometers used in general practice are very likely to be inaccurate and some may well be so deteriorated that they should be withdrawn from service. The results of the blood pressure audit showed digit bias in systolic and diastolic readings to the nearest 10 mm Hg. The implications for clinical care ‐ both over diagnosis and under diagnosis ‐ although not assessed are likely to be appreciable. PCG Clinical Governance teams in conjunction with Practice Clinical Leads must address these basic issues.

AB  -  In clinical practice, diagnosis and follow‐up of hypertension is based on blood pressure (BP) as measured by auscultatory method. BP is usually measured using a stethoscope to auscultate the Korotkoff sounds and mercury or an aneroid sphygmomanometer. However due to the lack of regulatory rules, the devices are rarely checked making the quality of the measures doubtful. OBJECTIVE: To compare BP measured following the WHO recommendations, using 2 different devices: the mercury or aneroid sphygmomanometer used by the physician and a SECURUS manometer that has been calibrated just before the implementation of the study. METHOD: The study was performed with 1694 French general practitioners. Every physician included 2 ambulatory patients: a newly diagnosed non‐treated hypertensive patient and a treated hypertensive patient. The physician was asked to include the first patient of each category attending his office. BP was measured sequentially with the 2 devices in a random order. Collected data were socio‐demographic parameters, cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension related diseases, drug treatment for hypertension and BP levels. RESULTS: Mean BPs differ by less than 1 mmHg between the 2 devices. However 10% of the treated hypertensive patients are not classified as having normalised BP values (BP < 140/90 mmHg) or high BP values, in the same way by the 2 devices. Mean absolute difference between the 2 devices is > 5 mmHg in 22% and 13% of the physicians for SBP and DBP respectively. CONCLUSION: This pilot study emphasises the need of BP measurements of good quality in clinical practice, because of the possible impact on the care of the patients and the related costs. Regulatory rules on the control of the devices might improve the quality of BP measurements.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Although mercury sphygmomanometers are seen as the gold standard instrument for blood pressure (BP) measurement, they are being withdrawn due to safety concerns. CRAB was a cluster‐randomized controlled trial in 24 family practices in Tasmania, Australia, which aimed to determine the effect of an oscillometric device on BP management. METHODS: Cluster‐randomized controlled trial. Intervention practices were supplied with automated monitors and control (usual care) practices used mercury or aneroid sphygmomanometers. They were subsequently audited by a research nurse. Usual care practice audit periods were matched to intervention practices. All analyses were intention‐to‐treat and adjusted for potential clustering. Differences in BP were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. All other outcomes were analyzed using multilevel mixed‐effects Poisson regression. Post hoc analyses were performed to determine the mediators of changes in prescribing behavior. RESULTS: A total of 3,355 records were reviewed (828 visits had BP recordings). The percentage of BP recordings ending in "0" was significantly lower in intervention vs. usual care practices (systolic BP (SBP) 18% (107/587) vs. 71% (233/329), diastolic BP (DBP) 20% (119/584) vs. 70% (229/328), P < 0.001). The mean of SBP recordings in the intervention group was 7.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2, 9.9 mm Hg, P < 0.001) higher than in the usual care group. Patients taking BP lowering drugs were more likely (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.7, P = 0.01) to have a BP lowering drug prescribed if they were in the intervention compared to the usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Although digit preference was largely eliminated by oscillometric measurement, prescribing behavior was mediated by SBP.

AB  -  The Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer was designed to eliminate observer bias and two digit preference. We have measured blood pressure (BP) in a group of 62 young adults (median age 26.1 years, range 20.2‐31.3 years) with reflux nephropathy under standardised conditions (that is, in the morning, after a 2 h supine rest, before venepuncture, using a standard 12 x 23 cm adult size cuff appropriate for the machine used) utilising the random zero sphygmomanometer and the automatic oscillometric BP monitor (Dinamap 8100, Critikon). Seven consecutive recordings of right brachial BP at intervals of 2 min were taken using each instrument alternatively, and the first reading was discarded. The first instrument used to measure BP was alternated between patients to eliminate bias on instrument preference. Random zero sphygmomanometer was used as recommended by the manufacturers and Korotkoff phase V was used to measure the DBP. The observer and the equipment used were the same throughout the study period. The mean SBP and DBP were calculated to the nearest 1 mm Hg utilising the three recordings taken by each instrument. The limits of agreement and the repeatability coefficients for each method of measurement were assessed utilising the statistical method described by Bland and Altman in 1986. The correlation coefficients among random zero and automatic oscillometric BP monitor for SBP and DBP measurements were 0.84 and 0.67, respectively. The average BP (mean of random zero and automatic oscillometric BP monitor measurement) plotted against the difference between the two methods of measurement showed no relation between the difference and the average of measurement in the ranges of BP studied, that is, between 100 and 160 mm Hg systolic and 55 and 100 mm Hg diastolic. The mean of difference between random zero and automatic oscillometric BP monitor for SBP was ‐6.45 (s.d. 6.07) and for DBP +10.77 (s.d. 8.16) mm Hg. The limit of agreement for SBP measurement was +5.69 to ‐18.59 mm Hg and for DBP was +27.09 to ‐5.55. The repeatability coefficients of random zero and automatic oscillometric BP monitor for systolic and diastolic measurements were 8.64 and 7.04, and 9.72 and 6.62, respectively. Bland and Altman analysis indicates major differences between the two methods of measurement. The automatic oscillometric BP monitor could on average over‐read the systolic by 6.45 mm Hg and under‐read the diastolic by 10.77 mm Hg compared with that of random zero. Furthermore, the limits of agreement were wide enough for a normotensive to be inadvertently defined as a hypertensive on machine error alone. This clearly indicates that automatic oscillometric BP monitor and random zero BP measurements cannot be used interchangeably in clinical practice. Furthermore, the repeatability coefficients, which should ideally be zero, are too large for either instrument to be considered as the gold standard for BP measurement, although that of automatic oscillometric BP monitor was superior to that of random zero. This study highlights the importance of using nomograms generated by the same method of measurement for comparison both in paediatric and adult practice for correct interpretation of BP.

AB  -  Objective: Hypertension in pregnancy is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Studies demonstrate that body positions affect the blood pressure (BP) measurements and have led to guidelines for proper positioning by the ACC and AHA. However, studies excluded pregnant women and did not include all common patient positions, such as semi‐Fowlers. These studies cannot be applied to pregnant women due to dynamic cardiovascular changes in pregnancy. Our objective was to determine if common patient positions affect BP measurements in pregnant women. Study Design: This was a prospective study (N=61). We measured BP in pregnant women in inpatient and outpatient settings in several positions including semi‐Fowler’s, seated without back and arm support (as on an exam table), and left lateral recumbent. The order of the measurements was randomized, and participants were kept sitting still for 5 minutes between positions. The measurements were compared to BP measurements observed in the published ACC/AHA guideline position: seated with arms and feet supported. Trained team members used an aneroid sphygmomanometer and stethoscope and/or a validated electronic BP machine. Results: There is no significant difference between BP measurements using a sphygmomanometer/stethoscope vs. an electronic BP machine in the ACC/AHA guideline position (systolic p=0.60 diastolic p=0.91). There was not a significant difference in either systolic or diastolic means in the semi‐Fowlers position (at 45 degrees measured by goniometer) (systolic P=0.60 diastolic P=0.95). Positioning did affect the diastolic BP measurement in the seated without support position (p=0.01) and both the systolic (p< 0.0001) and diastolic (p<0.0001) measurements in the left lateral recumbent position. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that an accurate BP measurement in pregnancy is dependent upon patient position. Blood pressure measurements in left lateral recumbency result in clinically significant variation in pregnant women. Semi‐Fowler's is a clinically reasonable alternative for measuring blood pressure when pregnant patients need to be lying down. [Formula presented]

AB  -  OBJECTIVES: To estimate accuracy and reliability of pharmacy‐based fixed‐location automated blood pressure devices (ABPDs) and to test the hypothesis that an ABPD is less accurate with more variable results than a home blood pressure device (HBPD). METHODS: Randomized study comparing 99 ABPDs with an Omron Digital HBPD in Indiana pharmacies. Each site was visited by one of five study investigators. A questionnaire was used to collect information about ABPDs. To test the ABPD against the HBPD, investigators measured their own blood pressure with each device three times in random order. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between HBPD and ABPD diastolic readings, whereas a statistically significant difference between HBPD and ABPD systolic readings was found. ABPD measurements are as reliable as HBPD measurements when comparing single measurements from each, but reliability differs with more than one reading. CONCLUSION: Compared with a valid HBPD, the ABPD produces inaccurate systolic blood pressure values but similar reliability. Regular blood pressure measurement by health professionals remains optimal for managing hypertensive individuals.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: The Hawksley random‐zero sphygmomanometer (random‐zero) has been used widely in epidemiological observation studies. This study compares blood pressure measurements using the random‐zero with measurements using an automated oscillometric device and suggests a correction of the automated oscillometric measurements to enable comparisons of blood pressure levels over time. METHODS: The northern Sweden MONICA population survey 2009 included 1729 participants, 853 men and 876 women, 25‐74 years old. Blood pressure was measured using both random‐zero and an automated oscillometric device in all participants. The Omron M7 digital blood pressure monitor was used for automated oscillometric measurements. A linear mixed model was used to derive a formula to adjust the automated oscillometric readings. RESULTS: Automated oscillometric measurements of systolic blood pressure were generally lower than random‐zero measurements in women [oscillometric mean 122.1 mmHg (95% confidence interval: 121.0‐123.2) versus random‐zero mean 124.4 mmHg (123.5‐125.5)], whereas automated oscillometric measurements of systolic blood pressure were generally higher than random‐zero measurements in men [oscillometric 131.1 mmHg (130.0‐132.2) versus random‐zero 129.0 mmHg (127.9‐130.1)]. For diastolic blood pressure, automated oscillometric measurements were higher in both women [oscillometric 79.9 mmHg (79.2‐80.5) versus random‐zero 76.7 mmHg (76.0‐77.4)] and men [oscillometric 83.1 mmHg (82.4‐83.8) vs. random‐zero 81.2 mmHg (80.6‐81.9)]. The difference also varied with age and order of measurement. Adjustment of the automated oscillometric measurements using mixed model regression coefficients produced estimates of blood pressure that were close to the random‐zero measurements. CONCLUSION: Blood pressure measurements using an automated oscillometric device differ from those with random‐zero, but the oscillometric measurements can be adjusted, on the basis of sex, age and measurement order, to be similar to the random‐zero measurements.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Terminal digit and single‐number preference may produce inaccuracy and biased results when measuring blood pressure. We describe these preferences in the Syst‐Eur randomized placebo‐controlled trial of the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension and describe how we sought to eliminate these problems. METHODS: The Data Monitoring Committee of the trial conducted yearly quality control meetings in Belgium and visited the participating centres to check their adherence to the protocol. These meetings involved identifying terminal digit preference, improving blood pressure control and boosting recruitment. RESULTS: The prevalence of use of terminal digit zero when measuring sitting systolic blood pressure (first readings) reduced from an average of 42.4% in the year prior to the date when a centre first randomized a patient to 31.5, 25, 22.3, 26.3, 23.2 and 22% in the subsequent 6 years. This trend was independent of the calendar year during which a centre entered the trial and supports the hypothesis that data‐quality monitoring, including the feedback of digit preference to centres, led to a reduction in terminal digit zero preference. In addition, a higher than expected prevalence of the systolic blood pressure value of 148 mmHg was found in the active treatment groups in the double‐blind phase. Selection for 148 mmHg persisted over time and constituted a single‐number preference bias. This arose from the instruction to investigators to reduce systolic blood pressure to below 150 mmHg. CONCLUSION: Monitoring and feedback of data quality should be undertaken to minimize digit and number preference. Automatic devices should ideally be employed to help to avoid these problems as long as the devices are fully validated and regularly serviced, and providing that readings are not rejected and repeated.

AB  -  Home blood pressure (HBP) measurement is becoming increasingly popular as an additional source of information for the practicing physician. Whether HBP measured with a fully automated oscillometric device (oHBP) is more reliable than HBP measured with an aneroid sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope (sHBP) remains unclear. We compared sHBP with oHBP using as a reference method daytime ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), as this is believed to be a better index of an individual's overall level of pressure. Forty‐six hypertensive patients measuring HBP with aneroid devices were retrained by a standard 30 min protocol that included training in the technique of measurement, checking patients' devices, and testing patients' performance in stethoscopic measurement. Patients were randomized to measure for 2 weeks either sHBP using their own calibrated aneroid devices or oHBP using a validated fully automated oscillometric device (Omron HEM‐705CP). Then 24 h ABP monitoring was performed (SpaceLabs 90207) and patients crossed over for a second 2 week period by using the alternative HBP measurement technique. Mean sHBP was not different from mean oHBP, and there was a close correlation between them (r = 0.82/0.76 for systolic/diastolic BP, P < .001). Daytime ABP was not different from oHBP or sHBP and was closely related to both of them (oHBP, r = 0.59/0.72 systolic/diastolic BP, P < .001; sHBP, 0.50/0.65, P < .001). Age was significantly related with diastolic ABP‐sHBP difference (r = 0.33, P < .05). These results suggest that HBP measured with validated fully automated oscillometric devices is equally reliable in predicting average ABP as that measured with calibrated aneroid sphygmomanometers used by very carefully trained patients. In clinical practice, HBP monitoring by using reliable automated devices is probably more feasible than to achieve a high standard of stethoscopic HBP measuring technique.

AB  -  Background: Office blood pressure (OBP) measurement is the most common method of blood pressure measurement. However, it is associated with several pitfalls as white coat effect and masked hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is usually used for diagnosis of hypertension and elimination of white coat effect. This study aimed to assess the correlation and degree of agreement of the automated sequential blood pressure (ASqBP) with OBP and ABPM. Patients presented to hypertension clinic were included. Each patient had his blood pressure recorded by three methods: OBP using a digital sphygmomanometer device, unattended ASqBP using sequential BP devices with recording of the readings over 30 min, and ABPM that was performed within 48 h of office visit using portable BP devices with BP recording over 24 h. Results: We recruited 64 patients (age 50.0 ± 15.0 years and female gender 53.1%). We found a strong positive correlation between ASqBP and OBP readings (r 0.81 for SBP and 0.83 for DBP, p < 0.001). We also found a strong positive correlation between ASqBP and ABPM readings (r 0.74, p < 0.001). The ASqBP readings were lower than OBP (137.0 ± 16.8/86.4 ± 13.8 vs. 142.7 ± 15.5/88.5 ± 12.3) and close to ABPM readings (average 24 h, 134.0 ± 15.4/88.5 ± 12.3, and daytime, 135.8 ± 15.7/82.1 ± 13.7). For SBP readings, there was moderate agreement between ASqBP and AMBP (both average and daytime). For DBP readings, there was fair agreement between ASqBP and AMBP (both average and daytime). Conclusion: ASqBP measurement has good correlation with OBP and ABPM readings. Unattended automated office pressure has moderate degree of agreement with ABPM for the SBP& fair degree of agreement for the DBP. It can be used in the hypertension clinics to eliminate the problems of white coat effect and marked BP variability.

AB  -  This study was done to evaluate prospectively whether ambulatory blood pressure recordings (AMB) (Spacelabs) would more accurately predict increases in left ventricular mass (LVMI) than did blood pressures measured by a nurse in the absence of a physician, using a random zero sphygmomanometer (RZ) and an automated oscillometric digital device (BPI). One hundred patients being followed by their family physician with a diagnosis of borderline hypertension with at least two office diastolic readings of 90‐100 mmHg were studied at baseline and every six months for two years with RZ, BPI, and AMB; echocardiography was repeated annually. Over sixty percent of the patients were normotensive in the research unit by AMB, BPI, and RZ at entry. At entry 24% of patients had increased LVMI greater than 110 g/m2 (left ventricular enlargement, LVE) and at 2 years 32% had LVE. Stepwise linear regression was used to determine which measurement was most predictive of LVE at two years. It showed that the most predictive were baseline echo LVMI and BPI systolic pressure. These two variables predicted 45% of the risk with no other variables contributing significantly. However, when BPI was removed, AMB systolic pressure contributed significantly, though the strength of prediction was reduced to 40%. In a subset of 40 patients who underwent mental stress with mental arithmetic and mirror tracing, the magnitude of systolic pressure elevation during mental stress correlated significantly with LVE over 2 years (R = 0.54, p < 0.001).

AB  -  INTRODUCTION: Obesity continues to disproportionately affect medically vulnerable populations. Digital health interventions may be effective for delivering obesity treatment in low‐resource primary care settings. METHODS: Track is a 12‐month randomized controlled trial of a digital health weight loss intervention in a community health center system. Participants are 351 obese men and women aged 21 to 65years with an obesity‐related comorbidity. Track participants are randomized to usual primary care or to a 12‐month intervention consisting of algorithm‐generated tailored behavior change goals, self‐monitoring via mobile technologies, daily self‐weighing using a network‐connected scale, skills training materials, 18 counseling phone calls with a Track coach, and primary care provider counseling. Participants are followed over 12months, with study visits at baseline, 6, and 12months. Anthropometric data, blood pressure, fasting lipids, glucose and HbA1C and self‐administered surveys are collected. Follow‐up data will be collected from the medical record at 24months. RESULTS: Participants are 68% female and on average 50.7years old with a mean BMI of 35.9kg/m(2). Participants are mainly black (54%) or white (33%); 12.5% are Hispanic. Participants are mostly employed and low‐income. Over 20% of the sample has hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Almost 27% of participants currently smoke and almost 20% score above the clinical threshold for depression. CONCLUSIONS: Track utilizes an innovative, digital health approach to reduce obesity and chronic disease risk among medically vulnerable adults in the primary care setting. Baseline characteristics reflect a socioeconomically disadvantaged, high‐risk patient population in need of evidence‐based obesity treatment.

AB  -  This randomized, single‐center, open, within‐subject study evaluated the performance of the Braun PrecisionSensor 2000 blood pressure (BP) measurement wrist device (BP 2000, Braun GmbH, Germany) with and without the position sensor, and compared the results with data obtained from 24‐h ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM, A&D TM 2430). In a crossover design, 43 subjects performed BP measurements with the BP 2000 during two 7‐day periods, one with the position sensor and the other without the position sensor. The correlation coefficients between all wrist self‐measurements and ABPM were 0.73 for systolic and 0.65 for diastolic BP (with position sensor) compared to 0.70 and 0.60 for readings without position sensor, respectively. The categorization of subjects as normotensive or hypertensive, using the wrist device in subjects without specific training, achieved a correct classification of 84% (with position sensor) and 81% (without position sensor) in comparison to ABPM. When the measurements were performed in the clinic by an experienced observer, the correct classification was 79% in comparison to ABPM. The crossover study design did not show any significant variation between the two devices with regard to reproducibility of readings at the wrist. In conclusion, self‐BP measurements with BP 2000, by untrained subjects, produced results consistent with those found recently with self‐BP measurements with upper arm devices, when both data sets are compared with ABPM. The rates of false classification of normotension/hypertension with the wrist device were small and at least as reliable as office measurements.

AB  -  The performance of the Copal Digital Sphygmomanometer UA251, a new semi‐automatic blood pressure recorder, was evaluated by comparing the results obtained simultaneously and on the same arm using the standard zero‐muddler sphygmomanometer. The study was performed on 67 hypertensive patients displaying a wide range of blood pressure and arm circumference. The agreement was acceptable with a mean difference, using the first set of readings of ‐0.45 (S.D. 2.9, range 8 to ‐5) and ‐0.95 (S.D. 2.6, range 6 to ‐4) mmHg for the systolic and diastolic pressures respectively. The repeatability of the Copal machine was also good; the mean difference between first and second measurements was ‐0.21 (S.D. 3.4, range 11 to ‐11) and ‐0.69 (S.D. 1.9, range 5 to ‐8) mmHg for systolic and diastolic readings respectively. Since this electronic machine has an acceptable accuracy, is readily portable, simple to use and relatively inexpensive, it seems suitable for use both in clinics and for more frequent monitoring of blood pressure throughout the day.

AB  -  INTRODUCTION: Discordance between blood pressure (BP) measurement methods can occur and create ambiguity. New automated office BP monitors (AOBPs) are widely available, but their role is presently unclear. The objectives of this study are to quantify concordance among BP measurement methods and to define the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of AOBPs in a population of hypertensive patients. METHODS: The office mercury sphygmomanometer, the AOBP, an ambulatory BP monitor (ABPM), and home self‐measurement with an automatic device were compared in a randomized, crossover study. BP averages and achievement of therapeutic goals were defined. Comparisons and agreement tests were performed. Diagnostic indices were calculated for the AOBP. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were enrolled. Average BP results were similar between measurement methods with the exception of daytime ABPM, which was significantly higher; figures are mean ± standard deviation (SD): sphygmomanometer, 129.9 ± 13.7/80.9 ± 9.3 mm Hg; AOBP, 128.4 ± 13.9/80.0 ± 9.4 mm Hg; 24‐hour ABPM, 131.4 ± 11.7/78.7 ± 9.7 mm Hg; day ABPM, 135.5 ± 11.4/82.0 ± 11.9 mm Hg; home self‐measurement, 131.0 ± 14.3/82.5 ± 8.2 mm Hg. Discordance in the achievement of therapeutic goals was observed in 58 patients, with only 26 cases being explained by masked hypertension or "white coat syndrome" according to all measurements. Disagreement was greater when office methods were compared with ambulatory methods. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the 4 measurement strategies provide similar average BP estimates but generate many discordant results. The AOBP device can be very valuable as a replacement for the sphygmomanometer.

AB  -  INTRODUCTION: Excessive weight gain and high blood pressure are strong risk factors for pregnancy outcome. Mobile applications are increasingly posited to facilitate a high‐resolution, bidirectional exchange between physician and patient. We developed an integrated system of mobile applications that incorporates remote patient monitoring together with an algorithm for triage system alerts ("triggers") on deviation from established American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists clinical guidelines. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and accuracy of our integrated system in regard to home vital sign measurement, triggers, and clinical measurements used in prenatal care. METHODS: We validated our trigger algorithm through 38 random simulations of longitudinal weight and blood pressure data. To demonstrate clinical utility, six low‐risk obstetric patients owning iPhone devices received a U.S. Food and Drug‐approved Wi‐Fi sphygmomanometer and weight scale together with a mobile app that integrated the data and provided prenatal educational material. Participants were asked to record weekly measurements. Weight and blood pressure baselines were calculated through the mobile app and compared with in‐clinic measurements to evaluate trigger alerts. RESULTS: Remote digital data collection was successful, with all participants recording both metrics with a frequency of more than once a week. Remote measurements fell within the 95% confidence interval of clinical measurements. The trigger system produced zero falsepositive and zero false‐negative results. CONCLUSION: Pregnant participants demonstrated ability and compliance using digital devices for remote clinical monitoring. Remote readings were highly correlated to clinical measurements, demonstrating validity of remote devices in collecting high‐resolution weight and blood pressure data. This model may have utility in monitoring and managing pregnant women between prenatal appointments.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Effective strategies to identify office‐induced hypertension in routine clinical practice are required to improve diagnosis and management of hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To compare the quality and accuracy of automated office blood pressure (AOBP) measurement using the BpTRU device with manual office blood pressure (MOBP) in routine clinical practice using awake ambulatory blood pressure (AABP) as the gold standard. METHODS: Primary care practices in Eastern Canada were allocated by cluster randomization to use of AOBP (36 practices, 52 physicians) or to MOBP (31 practices, 36 physicians) in patients with systolic hypertension. The last routine MOBP reading pre‐enrolment was compared to the blood pressure (BP) at the first visit after enrollment and after 2 years of follow‐up. The primary outcome measure was the mean difference between the AABP and MOBP versus AOBP. RESULTS: The mean (95% confidence interval) decrease in systolic BP from pre‐ to post‐enrollment was greater (P < 0.001) at the first visit in the 252 AOBP patients [‐14.3 (‐16.6, ‐12.0)] compared to the 209 MOBP patients [‐8.0 (‐2.2, ‐5.8)]. At Year 2, AOBP decreased by ‐16.3 (‐18.6, ‐14.1) compared to a decrease in MOBP of ‐12.4 (‐14.7, ‐10.1) (P = 0.02). The mean difference between systolic AABP and MOBP at the first post‐enrollment office visit [‐7.3 (‐9.7, ‐4.9)] was greater (P < 0.001) than the difference for AOBP [‐1.8 (‐4.0, 0.4)]. At Year 2, these differences were ‐5.2 (‐7.5, ‐3.0) for MOBP and ‐2.8 (‐4.9, ‐0.7) for AOBP (P = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: AOBP virtually eliminated office‐induced hypertension. The decrease in MOBP was attributed to participation in a research study and not to any specific intervention.

AB  -  The study will be a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover trial. We will recruit 25 children between the ages of 6 and 18 years, from the pediatric renal transplant program at Texas Children's Hospital. The study consists of three phases, a screening phase, and a treatment phase, and a crossover phase. Clinical study design: The study will be a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover trial. We will recruit 25 children between the ages of 6 and 18 years, from the pediatric renal transplant program at Texas Children's Hospital. The study consists of three phases, a screening phase, and a treatment phase, and a crossover phase. Laboratory Measurements: The laboratory measurements will be performed in the CLIA approved, clinical laboratory at Texas Children's Hospital. Definition of high blood pressure: We will use the guidelines for blood pressure measurement that have been adapted from the Update on the Task Force Report (1987) on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents [22]. Hypertension will be defined as >95th percentile blood pressure for age, height percentile (rounded to the nearest of 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, or 95th percentile of height above the patients actual height) and gender. Each blood pressure measurement will be the mean of 3 right arm readings, taken with an mercury sphygmomanometer at least three minutes apart with the patient sitting upright and relaxed. For the purposes of the study, to be defined as hypertensive, a patient will need to have mean systolic or diastolic blood pressure >95th percentile on three consecutive occasions, on separate days over at least a 1 week period. Patients with previously confirmed hypertension will be reconfirmed during the screening period. Screening phase: The screening phase will last between 1 and 2 weeks. Patients will be taught to use a digital blood pressure monitor with an appropriately sized cuff and be instructed to perform daily blood pressure measurements and keep a blood pressure log. Blood tests will be done to determine eligibility based on clinical laboratory parameters. Girls who are post‐menarche will have a urine pregnancy test. Each child will undergo 24hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during the screening phase. Children will collect urine for 24‐hours for the purpose of screening urinary nitrates and bradykinin. Phase 1: The active phase will last six weeks and include a clinic visit on the first day of the phase, laboratory testing between day 4 and 7, and weekly telephone contact throughout the phase. Subjects will receive allopurinol or placebo. Laboratory tests will be performed 4 to 7 days after starting the medication to screen for hepatic or bone marrow toxicity (AST, ALT, CBC), renal function (Cr), cyclosporin or tacrolimus level and serum uric acid. Evidence for toxicity, increased creatinine or unstable cyclosporin levels will lead to immediate discontinuation of allopurinol withdrawal from the study. The families will also be instructed to continue the daily blood pressure log started in the screening phase. At the end of the phase, prior to discontinuation of the allopurinol, children will again undergo 24hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Children will repeat the 24‐hour urine collection for the purpose of screening urinary nitrates and bradykinin. Washout Phase: There will be a two‐week washout interval between the allopurinol and placebo phases. Crossover Phase: The crossover phase will identical in procedures to the active phase except that the children will be receiving allopurinol or placebo, whichever was not received in Phase 1.

AB  -  The Sphygmomat 2 blood pressure monitor is a compact and portable electronic device based on detection of Korotkoff sounds using a piezo‐electric microphone. We have compared its accuracy with the Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer, which is commonly used in epidemiological and pharmacological studies. Comparison of manometers was conducted by two trained observers on 49 people with a wide range of blood pressures. The Sphygmomat 2 was found to have a median difference of 5.2 mmHg for systolic and 1 mmHg for diastolic pressure, in both cases reading higher than the Hawksley sphygmomanometer. The portability, versatility and accuracy suggest that the Sphygmomat 2 is a valuable instrument for general clinical use.

AB  -  Carotid‐femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) is the gold standard method for assessing arterial stiffness. This study evaluated automated brachial‐ankle PWV (baPWV) taken by a professional oscillometric blood pressure monitor (Microlife WatchBP Office Vascular) versus reference cfPWV (Complior device). Subjects recruited from a hypertension outpatient clinic had duplicate baPWV and cfPWV measurements (randomized crossover design) and carotid ultrasonography. Of 102 subjects recruited, 101 had valid baPWV measurements. Four subjects were excluded and 97 were analyzed (age 58.3 ± 11.4 years, men 70%, hypertensives 76%, diabetics 17%, cardiovascular disease 10%, smokers 23%). The mean difference between baPWV (13.1 ± 1.8 m/s) and cfPWV (9.1 ± 1.8 m/s) was 4.0 ± 1.4 m/s (P <.01) with close association between them (r = 0.70, P <.01). baPWV and cfPWV were correlated with age (r 0.54/0.49 respectively), systolic blood pressure (0.45/0.50), carotid intima‐media thickness (0.31/0.44), and carotid distensibility coefficient (−0.47/−0.34) (all P <.05; no difference between the two methods, z test). There was reasonable agreement (77%) between the two methods in identifying subjects at the top quartile of their distributions (kappa 0.39, P <.01). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the identification of carotid plaques were comparable for cfPWV and baPWV (0.79 and 0.74 respectively, P = NS). Automated baPWV measurement by a professional oscillometric blood pressure monitor is feasible and observer‐independent. baPWV values differ from those by cfPWV, yet they are closely correlated, have reasonable agreement in detecting increased arterial stiffness and give similar associations with carotid stiffness and atherosclerosis.

AB  -  Objective This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the automated oscillometric wrist blood pressure monitor SCIAN LD‐735 for home blood pressure monitoring according to the International Protocol of the European Society of Hypertension revision 2010. Methods Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured sequentially in 33 adult Chinese participants (10 women, mean age 44.8 years) using a mercury sphygmomanometer (two observers) and the SCIAN LD‐735 device (one supervisor). A total of 99 pairs of comparisons were obtained from 33 participants for judgments in two parts with three grading phases. Results The SCIAN LD‐735 device achieved the targets in part 1 of the validation study. The number of absolute differences between device and observers within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg was 86/99, 97/99, and 98/99, respectively, for systolic blood pressure and 85/99, 98/99, and 99/99, respectively, for diastolic blood pressure. The device also fulfilled the criteria in part 2 of the validation study. In total, 30 and 33 participants for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, had at least two of the three device‐observer differences within 5 mmHg (required >24). No participant had all of the three device‐observer comparisons greater than 5 mmHg for systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Conclusion The SCIAN wrist blood pressure monitor LD‐735 has passed the requirements of the International Protocol revision 2010, and hence can be recommended for home use in adults.

AB  -  Measuring blood pressure in the clinic setting is confounded by 'white coat' hypertension, observer bias and digit preference. In this study a semiautomatic blood pressure measuring device (the UA‐751) was tested for its use as a reliable assessment of blood pressure and improved patient management in the hypertension clinic. Blood pressures were recorded in 156 patients and compared with physicians' readings measured using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. The mean blood pressure differences between the two methods showed that the device gave consistently higher readings for both systolic (1.4‐3.6 mmHg) and diastolic (3.6‐3.8 mmHg) pressure, whether it was used before or after physician consultation. No reduction in 'white coat' hypertension was thus apparent. There was considerable variability between recordings made by the two methods on the same individual. Digit preference was apparent with physician readings, with zero recorded in 57.8% of systolic readings compared with 12.2% using the machine. Different management decisions would have been taken in 20 (13.6%) patients had the UA‐751 recordings been used. The device is thus of no value in patient management in the setting of the hypertension clinic.

AB  -  The purpose of this study was to validate the automated BPLab® sphygmomanometer for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in pregnant women according to Part II of the 1993 British Hypertension Society protocol. Pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic were randomly asked to participate (n=30). The BPLab sphygmomanometer was tested on pregnant women in this study and achieved A/A ratings according to the BHS protocol when compared with the “gold” standard of mercury sphygmomanometry. The device can therefore be recommended for use in pregnancy.

AB  -  Objective: The primary aim of the study is to investigate the effect of aromatherapy on blood pressure and stress response by inhalation and foot massage in individuals with essential hypertension. Secondary aims; ‐ to define the effect of aromatherapy inhalation method and foot massage application on blood pressure and heart rate in individuals with essential hypertension, ‐ to define the effects of aromatherapy inhalation method and foot massage application on blood cortisol levels in individuals with essential hypertension, ‐ to define the effects of aromatherapy inhalation method and foot massage application on anxiety scores in individuals with essential hypertension. Hypothesis: ‐ H0‐1: Aromatherapy inhalation method has no significant effect on blood pressure in individuals with essential hypertension. ‐ H1‐1: Aromatherapy inhalation method has a significant effect on blood pressure in individuals with essential hypertension. ‐ H0‐2: Aromatherapy inhalation method does not have a significant effect on stress response in individuals with essential hypertension. ‐ H1‐2: Aromatherapy inhalation method has a significant effect on stress response in individuals with essential hypertension. ‐ H0‐3: Foot massage application does not have a significant effect on blood pressure in individuals with essential hypertension. ‐ H1‐3: Foot massage application has a significant effect on blood pressure in individuals with essential hypertension. ‐ H0‐4: Foot massage application in patients with essential hypertension has no significant effect on stress response. ‐ H1‐4: Foot massage application in patients with essential hypertension has a significant effect on stress response. Methods: The randomized controlled trial is performed with 69 individuals diagnosed with essential hypertension hospitalized.There are two interventions (group 1: aromatherapy‐inhalation method, group 2: aromatherapy‐foot massage) and a control group in the study. In power analysis based on blood cortisol level,80% power, 95% confidence interval, effect size 0.39, standard deviation 3.09 were calculated and 23 participants in each group were determined. Blood pressure is measured with a digital sphygmomanometer after 10 minutes of rest; stress response is determined by heart rate, blood cortisol levels and anxiety scale. Aromatherapy with lavender oil is applied to the intervention groups; no application is made to the control group and routine follow‐up at the hospital continued. The group‐1 smells sterile cloth with 5 drops of lavender oil for five minutes and is done every other day for three days. Group‐2 receives a total of 20 minutes of foot massage with 5 drops of lavender oil for each foot and is applied every other day for three days. Aromatherapy is performed between 07:00 and 08:00 in the morning hours when the blood cortisol value peaked at the highest level and homogeneity is achieved in terms of application. Measures: For intervention groups (group 1 and 2), blood pressure and heart rate will be measured seven times in total, both at the first interview and before and after each application, 10 minutes after the application; for control group, it is a total of seven times, both once in the first interview and twice every other day. Blood cortisol level is measured four times in total for the intervention groups, both at the beginning and after each application; For the control group, it is measured at the same time as the intervention groups at baseline and on the third follow‐up day (twice in total). Anxiety scale (Spielberger State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory) is used for subjective stress response. Trait Anxiety Inventory is evaluated at the beginning of the study for both groups (only once). State Anxiety Inventory, for intervention groups, is applied four times both before and after the first application and before and after the third application; for control group is applied twice, on the first follow‐up day and on the third follow‐up day. Analysis: Statistical methods to be used for study data; ‐ Descriptive statistics (number and percentage, average, standard deviation) ‐ T test (Parametric), Mann Whitney U test (nonparametric) (according to the suitability of the data for normal distribution) ‐ One‐way anova (Parametric), Kruskal Wallis Test (nonparametric) (according to the normal distribution of data) ‐ Pearson / Spearman Correlation (according to the suitability of the data for normal distribution) ‐ Analysis of variance in repeated measurements ‐ Regression analysis

AB  -  The aim of this study was to determine concordance between physician and patient blood pressure (BP) measurements in an ambulatory setting. A diagnostic intervention cross‐sectional study using a convenience sample was employed. A total of 106 hypertensive patients were included in the study. Patients who were unable to perform their self‐measurement or those with cardiac arrhythmia were excluded. BP was determined nine times in each subject in the medical office in a randomised order: BP was taken three times by the physician using a mercury sphygmomanometer (SPH‐Hg), three times by the physician using a validated, automated oscillometer (Omron HEM 705 CP), and three times by the patient himself with the same device. The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated. In all, 59 women and 47 men aged 65.7 (10) years were analysed. Mean BP measurements for the physician using the mercury sphygmomanometer, the physician using the Omron, and the patient using the same device were: 136 (15.8)/80 (11), 137 (17.9)/80 (10), and 139* (17.6)/80 (10) mmHg, respectively. BP control was 48.1, 48.1, and 36.8*% (*P < 0.05), respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients for systolic/diastolic pressures were: 0.77/0.65 (physician‐sphygmomanometer Hg, physician‐Omron; P < 0.001), 0.75/0.64 (physician‐sphygmomanometer Hg, patient‐Omron, P < 0.001), and 0.83/0.83 (physician‐Omron, patient‐Omron; P < 0.001). In conclusion, the three types of measurement in the medical office were significantly concordant. Patient office self‐measurement showed a tendency to increase systolic BP and worsen BP control.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing popularity of wrist‐cuff blood pressure (BP) devices, their accuracy has not been established and international guidelines do not support their use. Because arm position influences BP measurement, it is possible that conflicting reports on wrist‐cuff device accuracy reflects diverse arm positions. METHOD: This study compared BP measured by two oscillometric devices, the upper arm‐cuff OMRON HEM 705 CP and the OMRON R6 oscillometric wrist‐cuff device. In the former BP was measured with the arm in two supported positions, dependent on a table (manufacturer's instructions) and horizontal (mid sternum), while the latter followed the manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS: In contrast to the dependent arm where BP was significantly higher (P<0.05), the horizontal arm position with the arm‐cuff produced a mean systolic and diastolic BP comparable to the wrist‐cuff device where the wrist was at heart level being respectively, 137+/‐29/80+/‐16 and 134+/‐27/77+/‐16 mmHg. A close relationship over a wide BP range was also confirmed by least squares, least product linear regression and Bland‐Altman analysis. CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of wrist‐cuff monitors for self/home use and underlines the need for a more precise definition for arm position when using all BP devices ‐‐ mercury and oscillometric.

AB  -  Introduction: The action of dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors on blood pressure (BP) and arterial stiffness is controversial. This study aimed to investigate the effects of DPP‐4 inhibitor (vildagliptin) on the BP and arterial stiffness. Methods: Fifty patients over 35 years of age with diabetes and hypertension without cardiovascular disease were randomized to vildagliptin (n=25) or glibenclamide (n=25) in a prospective, open, drug‐controlled study. Both groups used metformin and renin angiotensin system blockers. BP was evaluated by digital sphygmomanometer and by 24‐hour ambulatory BP monitoring with the Mobil‐O‐Graph PWA® device, which analyzes parameters of arterial stiffness (central systolic BP, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx75). Laboratory evaluation (glycemia and glycated hemoglobin), and BP and arterial stiffness measurements were performed before and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results: Glycated hemoglobin reduced non‐significantly with treatment in both groups. 24‐hour systolic BP decreased significantly in the vildagliptin (123.8±12.5 vs 119.1 ± 1.7 mmHg, P=0.03) and glibenclamide group (125.1 ± 12.2 vs 117.3 ± 8.0 mmHg, P=0.002), but without difference between the groups. There were no changes in central systolic BP and PWV in the vildagliptin group before and after treament. However, in the glibenclamide group, central systolic BP decreased (116.4±12.19 vs 109.0±7.5, mmHg P=0.003), as well as PWV (8.5±1.3 vs 8.1±1.1 m/s, P=0.003), but with no difference between groups (P=0.27 and 0.32, respectively). There was also no difference for 24 hour AIx75 for both drugs. Pearson's correlation did not demonstrate a correlation of glycemic control with PWV and AIx75. However, office systolic BP and central pulse pressure showed correlation with PWV in the vildagliptin group (P=0.008 and 0.002, respectively) and glibenclamide (P<0.001 and 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Vildagliptin does not alter BP and arterial stiffness in diabetic and hypertensive patients. The observed improvement in 24‐hour BP is due the antihypertensive treatment, as it was demonstrated in the 2 groups. Unlike blood glucose, BP correlates to arterial stiffness.

AB  -  Background and rationale Many comments have been issued about similarities and differences between 2003 American and European guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension (1,2), especially after the publication of the Antihypertensive and Lipid‐Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) study (3‐5). Both guidelines agree that the majority of hypertensive patients require more than one medication to achieve optimal blood pressure control and, consistent with the most recent findings, the need of expensive, large clinical trials to demonstrate the superiority of one medication on another is probably over (3,6). What is clear now is that blood pressure must be optimally controlled to reduce risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in population, no matter which combination of medications is used. Comparison between single medications is substantially academic and conceals the reality: in all trials, in most circumstances comparison is between combinations, more than single medications. In the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction Study (LIFE study) (6), for instance, there has been a comparison between the combination of losartan with low dose hydrochlorothiazide versus the combination of atenolol with the same diuretic. The difference between the seventh Joint National Committee (USA) on Prevention, Diagnosis and Management of Hypertension (JNC VII) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2003 guidelines, often presented as substantial, is in the priority that Americans still give to the diuretic therapy, consistent with the most waited results of the ALLHAT (3). The ALLHAT was a randomized, double‐blind, multicenter clinical institutional trial, entirely sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (3), and designed to determine whether occurrence of fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease is lower for high risk hypertensive patients treated with amlodipine, lisinopril, doxazosin, or chlorthalidone. The protocol was also approved by an independent Review Committee external to the NHLBI (7). The ALLHAT recruited 9,000‐15,000 participants/intervention arm (total: 33,357), and the follow‐up was quite long (4‐8 years). The doxazosin arm was closed prematurely because of higher mortality (8). Despite a number of important limitations of this study (4,9), the overall impact of its findings remains very high. The baseline characteristics of the ALLHAT participants were substantially similar in the 3 arms completing the study. Chlortalidone was significantly more effective than both amlodipine and lisinopril in achieving optimal control of blood pressure at year 1 and year 2 and more effective than lisinopril in blood pressure control at year 3, 4 and 5 (all p<0.001). Consistent with the better control of blood pressure, chlortalidone tended to provide a 10% more protection for combined fatal and non fatal coronary heart disease than lisinopril whereas protection was similar for amlodipine, though this protection was less evident than the superiority in controlling blood pressure. In fact, the difference in risk profile versus the lisinopril arm achieved statistical significance only for elderly and African‐American participants. Another relevant finding from the ALLHAT concerns the incidence of congestive heart failure that was substantially less with chlortalidone than with either amlodipine or lisinopril. There are many recurrent criticisms to all trials showing the superiority of diuretics over other medications in controlling blood pressure. First of all, worsening of glucose metabolism, due to thiazide effects, is matter of concern (4,14‐18). Also the ALLHAT authors report a higher incidence of diabetes in the diuretic group which, however, did not affect the outcome results (3). However, this concern is also sustained by recent evidence of the dangerous effect of incident diabetes in patients with arterial hypertension (15). One factor that might aggravate glucose metabolism during therapy with diuretics is the underestimated effect of hypokalemia, which interferes with glucose‐stimulated insulin release, a condition that might be aggravated by association with beta‐adrenergic block (19,20). Among other beneficial effects, including improvement in blood pressure control, correction of hypokalemia prevents or significantly reduces thiazide‐induced hyperglycemia (21‐24). It is possible that low‐dose potassium‐sparing diuretics by preventing hypokaleemia might also prevent metabolic effects of thiazide, at the same time enhancing the antihypertensive effects of thiazide (25), but, this hypothesis has never been tested in ad hoc trials. The second concern about the use of diuretics is the risk of low therapeutic compliance of hypertensive patients, due to the diuretic effect and other hypokalemia‐related side‐effects (26,27). These few reports, however, contrast with the evidence that quality of life is improved by long term therapy with diuretics (28‐30). The effort, therefore, should probably be direct toward persistence of initial treatment with diuretics, a goal that might be reached by improving the procedures of follow‐up, for instance, as we have recently proposed, by implementing internet‐based digital networks, connecting hypertension specialists with general practitioners (31). The Campania Salute (CS)network is a system that was set up in 1995 by us (31). It is an italian regional network system aimed at improving the management of essential hypertension by integrating the activity of general practitioners (GPs) with hypertension specialists. This network includes about 12.000 hypertensive patients followed by 23 outpatient hypertensive clinics allocated in different Community Hospitals in the Campania Region and 60 GPs, homogeneously allocated in the regional area, referring to the Hypertension Clinic of Federico II University Hospital in Naples (coordinating centre). GPs were randomly selected among a pool of physicians referring their patients to the Hypertension Clinic at Federico II University. Through the CS system clinical data detected at each visit can be shared between the coordinating center and the peripheral units.Low‐risk hypertensive patients continue their follow up in the peripheral units, whereas high‐risk hypertensive patients are more closely followed up by the coordinating centre, which also evaluates target organ damage and associated diseases. Patients' information is shared through on‐line access to the remote database, integrated by smartcards. The smartcard belongs to patients and contains his/her personal identification number (PIN). This PIN allows users to access the file of the patient stored in the database. Each physician has also his own PIN to access into the database, limited to his/her own patient files. Clinical data are upgraded at each visit by GPs and physicians of both peripheral centres and coordinator centre. Access to the remote database allows users to read all clinical and laboratory data, as well as tracking electrocardiography (ECG) and cardiac and vascular ultrasound images. In addition, the smartcard also works as portable database in which identification and clinical data are reported. By virtue of a central database, data of individual patients can be stored, updated and retrieved directly on‐line by participants in the project. The restricted access to individual data requires the pre‐assigned identification code of both the patient and the relevant remote units. The central database uses Wincare software (TSD Projects, Milan, Italy) which contains separate sheets for medical history, physical examination, biochemistry electrocardiography, cardiovascular ultrasound, other imaging tests and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The last update of an individual patient's record can also be downloaded and stored in the patient's personal smartcard. We started the CS project with the aim of obtaining a stronger interaction between GPs and hypertension clinics, by providing a direct link and accessible patients' records. Blood pressure control was improved with our referral system, since better overall results were obtained if the patient was followed within the network. Indeed, at the end of the observation period, 51% of patients in the CS group had a blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg, a percentage comparable to that of patients included in clinical trials. This follow‐up strategy also allowed an active pharmacovigilance procedure, with side effects promptly reported to the GPs, which prevented the occurrence of difference in compliance among the various antihypertensive treatments. In addition, this kind of follow‐up allowed by means of pharmacogenetic studies to demonstrate that the occurrence of side effects may be predicted from individual genotype (32). Indeed, we have recently reported that in patients bearing β2AR gene Glu27 variant or the β3AR gene Arg64 variant there was a larger occurrence of hypertriglyceridemia, alone or in combination with elevated cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the β2AR Glu27variant significantly associates with hypetriglyceridemia in a cumulative fashion. The risk of developing this side effect after β‐blockade was four‐fold higher in patients homozygous for the β2AR Glu27 variant than in β2AR27Gln allele. This result not only allowed the identification of patients at high risk to develop metabolic complications to chronic β‐blockade treatment, but also contributed to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms which mediate these side effects, raising the possibility to prevent them. Objectives of the study This study has been designed to assess whether a follow‐up strategy based on a strict cooperation between GPs and hypertension specialists allows the use of diuretics as first‐line antihypertensive treatment with a persistence on assigned therapy equivalent to that achieved by using any other first line antihypertensive therapy. Assessment of safety and efficacy for controlling cardiovascular risk will be also performed as secondary endpoint. In fact, in contrast with trials comparing single‐drug effects, this study compares two strategies of antihypertensive management, based on either real‐word prescriptions or a regimen in which thiazide diuretics represent a forced first line antihypertensive therapy. If our hypothesis will be demonstrated diuretics might be suggested as an efficient and economic first line antihypertensive treatment, on which build up optimal antihypertensive therapy by adding other class drugs, in all patients, provided that the follow‐up procedure is based on the proposed organization. This approach will be of great utility for the National Health Care System to reduce costs, since, a large part of the economic burden is related to the use of antihypertensive medications more expensive than thiazides, as first line agents, in particular so far only 40% of the hypertensive patients receive diuretics in their therapy. Finally, the pharmacogenetic study is focused on characterization of polymorphisms of candidate genes associated to development of metabolic side effects of diuretics, to help understanding of mechanisms underlying these adverse events. This kind of information will help to prevent the occurrence of adverse events by the use of adeguate combination treatment, thus resulting in the further reduction of the cost of antihypertensive treatment due to the reduction of the number of patients that discontinue therapy for occurrence of adverse events. Study design This is a multicenter, open label, randomized study to compare the effects of an antihypertensive strategy using a thiazide diuretic as first‐line, versus the use as initial therapy of other antihypertensive treatments. All the analyses will be performed by personel blinded to treatment. The study will be performed in collaboration with the Società Italiana Medicina Generale (SIMG), Sezione Campania, and the Società Italiana Ipertensione Arteriosa (SIIA), Sezione Campania. Study population. The recruitment phase will last 8 months. During this period 2600 patients will be enrolled, in the offices of 260 GPs' with documented previous experience in controlled studies, performed according to recommendations of Good Clinical Practice, and availability to access to Internet. Selected GPs will be trained to the use of the web‐based database on which they will store the required information of patients participating into the study. This training period will last a week and will be supervised by the coordinator's center. Exemplificative print outs of the web‐based CRF are available for evaluation on the web site www.campaniasalute.it. GPs are required: 1) to record a full medical history, including smoking and drinking habits, based on a pre‐defined clinical record; 2) to collect demographic and anthropometric measures (height, weight, waist circumference at the iliac crest); 3) to perform a complete physical exam. At baseline and at each visit thereafter, seated office blood pressure will be measured in triplicate using a manual sphygmomanometer according to international guidelines. Measurements will be rounded to the closest 2 mmHg interval. Inclusion criteria: Hypertensive patients will be 18 to 75‐year old. Eligible patients are required to have stage Ic or II essential hypertension, and to be previously untreated or poorly controlled. They will be selected by GPs participating into the study. Similar to untreated patients, those with poor control of blood pressure under multiple‐drug therapy will start treatment with one single drug, which will be titrated to the highest dose before adding subsequent medications, based on the GP's judgement. Hypertension will be defined according to 2003 ESH/ESC guidelines (1). Blood and urine tests will be performed, according to guidelines for Hypertension Management For General Practitioners (GP) of the Regione Campania (see Bollettino Ufficiale Regione Campania, number 11, 18/02/2002, allegato A). This screening includes cell blood counts (CBCs), serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, uric acid, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL‐cholesterol, glucose, urine analysis and EKG. LDL will be calculated starting from the total cholesterol, triglyceride and HDL‐cholesterol. Exclusion criteria. Women in fertile age not using recognized contraceptive methods, or pregnant or nursing will be excluded from the protocol, since the use of many antihypertensive drugs is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation. Patients will be excluded when presenting with documented coronary or cerebrovascular events in the previous 6 months, NYHA class higher than 1, history of congestive heart failure, secondary hypertension, cancer disease, renal disease (serum creatinine >2 mg/dl), liver cirrhosis or severe dysfunction, or any other health problem that may interfere with the projected 2 year follow‐up. Data will be stored in an electronic database located in the Coordinating Centre, to which GPs may have access for uploading data on a daily base, using personal, encrypted, login and password. Eligible patients will be asked for written informed consent and thereafter referred to the identified Hypertension Specialist Centre located in their areas, for end‐organ damage evaluation by echocardiography, carotid ultrasound and urine dip‐stick. These data will be stored in the central database. After local echocardiographic evaluation, patients showing left ventricular Ejection Fraction < 45% will be excluded from the study. Eligible patients will be asked for blood sampling for genomic DNA analysis and then randomised by the coordinating centre to either diuretics or other treatment. This latter will be decided by the GPs. Randomization will be organized in permuted blocks of 10 patients for each GP, half of which will be assigned to diuretics. The randomization code will be communicated to the referring GP by e‐mail. Blood samples for genetic analysis and signed informed consents will be sent to the coordinating centre for storage. Blood samples will be coded and anonymously processed for genetic analysis by the Department of Pharmacology of FEDERICO II University of Naples. The data resulting from this analysis will be stored in the patient CRF page. Intervention: Drugs will be administered orally. GPs should use chlortalidone (12.5‐25 mg daily) in the arm with compulsive thiazide diuretic as first line. In the alternative arm, GPs may choose any appropriate single‐drug (excluding thiazide diuretic) or combination therapy, as first‐line, at the tolerated dose. After randomization, patients will be evaluated monthly at the GPs' office, for therapy adjustment, to achieve blood pressure normalization (i.e Systolic Blood pressure >140 mmHg, and Diastolic Blood pressure >90 mmHg). In the thiazide arm, if blood pressure normalization is not achieved not even with the maximal dose, it will be possible to add any other classes of antihypertensive drugs. Once blood pressure normalization is achieved, GPs will monitor blood pressure once every 2 months, at the renewal of the drug prescription. Blood pressure values will be stored in the central database. At each visit, GPs will record drug therapy, including concomitant medications, evaluate the compliance to assigned antihypertensive regimen, and monitor and record adverse events by reporting all data in the CRF. After two years from randomization, patients will be checked for blood and urine tests and referred to the Hypertension Specialist Centre for echocardiography, carotid ultrasounds and urine dip‐stick. This data will be stored in the central database. Information retrieval: At each visit, the GPs will record drug therapy, including concomitant medications, will evaluate the compliance to the assigned antihypertensive medications by pill count, and will monitor and record adverse events by reporting all data in the CRF. Pre clinical cardiovascular disease will be assessed by echocardiography and carotid ultrasonography. All ultrasound exams will be sent to the Reading Center at Federico II University Hospital and will be processed, according to procedures described in the annex. Monitoring of the study: All data will be reported on a specifically designed electronic clinical research form (CRF) (see web site: www.campaniasalute.com), and will be transferred to the Coordinating Center for data storage and analysis. The Steering Committee will appoint a Data Coordinating Committee to evaluate all CRFs on a continuous way to ensure quality and objectivity of the analysis performed by trained professionals. In order to monitor for patient security, GPs will be asked to actively monitor periodically for adverse events, by asking patients at the time of drug prescription renewal for the occurrence of symptoms or signs that can be related to aggravation of their condition or adverse events of therapy. In selected cases, GPs can refer the patients to the Hypertension Specialist Centre for eventual instrumental and or blood and urinary analyses. Adverse events will be reported in the digital CRF. Sample size estimate: The main outcome to be tested is whether persitance on therapy of an antihypertensive regimen based on diuretics as first choice is equivalent to that obtained in a free regimen using any other antihypertensive medication as first choice (equivalence study). As secondary outcomes, reduction of left ventricle (LV) mass and carotid intima‐media thickness will be evaluated as markers of preclinical cardiovascular disease, under the hypothesis that improvement of end‐organ damage under diuretic‐based treatment will not be different from the treatment based on other antihypertensive medications (equivalence). The reduction of the ESH/ESC risk‐score will also be evaluated, under the same equivalence hypothesis. Sample size was primarily estimated for the primary outcome, but afterward tested on power also on secondary outcomes. See Annex for details Organizational characteristics: The study will be governed by a Steering Committee chaired by the Principal Investigator (Prof. Bruno Trimarco). The study will be performed as a collaborative effort of 260 general practitioners (with previous experience in scientific initiatives), specialist centers (Community Hospitals and University Hospitals in which specialized evaluation of hypertension related organ damage is routinely evaluated). The Department of Medicina Clinica, Scienze Cardiovascolari ed Immunologiche, division of Coronary Intensive Care Unit and High Blood Pressure Center will act as a Coordinating Center, run by Professor Trimarco, PI. The central database will be stored at this center, and the other specialist centers and GPs will have remote access to it through encrypted login and password. The web‐based access to the database has already been implemented at the Coordinating Center, within the Campania Salute Project, a regional network of Community Hospitals and GPs. Echocardiograms and carotid ultrasounds will be performed at the Federico II University Hospital or in peripheral centers, under a standardized protocol, which will be distributed in an electronic format (CD‐ROM). All studies will be directly transmitted through the Internet to the Reading Center. Feasibility: The Principal Investigator, Bruno Trimarco, has a long and extensive experience in running trials of antihypertensive treatment and management of hypertension (see CV). As Director of the Coordinating Institution he will personally assure full support of the institution facilities, and of professional help in monitoring and statistics. The Ultrasound Reading Center has wide experience in centralized reading of studies on LV hypertrophy and function as well as in studies on arterial structure and has been involved in a number of international multicenter trials (35,40). The Reading Center is provided of 4 work stations for echocardiographic reading and 2 for carotid ultrasound, with high level of security for preservation of data and privacy. All echocardiograms will be classified with a reception number which will join the recruitment number of the participant (every participants will have 2 identification numbers in addition to the number of identification document). Timing: The study will last 3 years. The first eigth months will be spent for recruitment and randomization. The follow‐up will last 2 years. Analysis of data will be performed ad interim, as soon as the last recruited patient completes the intermediate evaluation after one year of follow‐up. Final main analysis will be performed right after the conclusion of follow‐up of the last recruited patient. A number of analysis concerning secondary end‐points and including every ancillary study that might be proposed from the Steering Committee or the participating Hypertension Specialist Centres, will be implemented thereafter. Ethical aspects. We have tried to minimize possible therapy related side effects to those that are usually observed in the practical clinic. Indeed, all treatments and dosages are those that are usually adopted by general practitioner for the daily practice. Therefore, we do not expect any additional risk for patients that are enrolled in the study. The complications that are associated to thiazide treatment will be prevented by the use of maximal doses that are in the low range of therapeutic effect, and close to the regimen that currently used in daily practice. As for intromission in the private sphere of the patients, the data will be nominally entered in the database by the physician using a login/password protected web‐based 32bit encrypted connection, and available only for this research purposes after given informed consent by the patients.

AB  -  OBJECTIVES: There is an ongoing controversy about the magnitude of the difference between unattended automated office blood pressure (AOBP) and conventional office blood pressure (BP). The aim of our study was to compare unattended AOBP with both auscultatory BP and oscillometric attended AOBP in an epidemiological setting. METHODS: In 2588 participants of the Czech post‐MoNItoring of CArdiovascular Disease study (a randomly selected 1% representative population sample aged 25‐64 years, mean age 48â€ŠÂ±â€Š11 years, 47.5% males), BP was measured using an AOBP device unattended, auscultatory mercury sphygmomanometer and an oscillometric attended AOBP device. RESULTS: On average, auscultatory BP was 10.6/5.6â€ŠmmHg higher than unattended AOBP. Similarly, oscillometric attended AOBP was 9.9/3.4â€ŠmmHg higher than unattended AOBP, while the mean difference between attended oscillometric AOBP and auscultatory BP was 0.8/2.1â€ŠmmHg. Unattended systolic AOBP of 127â€ŠmmHg corresponded to SBP of 140â€ŠmmHg measured by a conventional sphygmomanometer. The prevalence of hypertension varied depending on the measurement technique and ranged from 31.5 to 40.1%. Reasonable agreement in hypertension diagnosis was observed with unattended AOBP cut‐off at least 130/85â€ŠmmHg when compared with both auscultatory (McNemar Pâ€Š=â€Š0.07, kappa 0.819) and attended oscillometric AOBP (McNemar Pâ€Š=â€Š0.46, kappa 0.852) thresholds of at least 140/90â€ŠmmHg. CONCLUSION: Unattended automated office SBP is on average 10â€ŠmmHg lower than the office auscultatory or attended AOBP values. In epidemiological settings, a threshold of unattended AOBP at least 130/85â€ŠmmHg should make comparison of hypertension prevalence possible with studies using auscultatory techniques and cut‐off values of 140/90â€ŠmmHg.

AB  -  Aim. To analyze correctness of office blood pressure (BP) measurement by physicians and home‐based BP monitoring (HBPM) ‐ by the patients, and to assess the efficacy of patients teaching for correct BP self‐measurement and control. Material and methods. Totally, 46 physicians questioned (32 local internists and 14 general practitioners with experience 2‐27 years) and 290 patients with arterial hypertension (AH). Results. It was revealed that the following parameters were not unified: choice of arm, size of a cuff, times BP measured, time interval for repeated measurement, recording of BP by patients and physicians. These parameters did not suffice totally the Russian guidelines on diagnostics and treatment of arterial hypertension. About a half of BP patients by themselves corrected antihypertension treatment and dealt with the "crises". Conclusion. Education of patients for BP measurement rules must be performed in "AH schools" and in offices (prevention departments) under supervision of local internists and general practitioners. Such events, as regular update of sphygmomanometers and supply physicians by cuffs of various size, will help to achieve better BP measurement quality in office, as in screening.

AB  -  New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES) was a population‐based cross‐sectional survey of NYC adults conducted twice, in 2004 and again in 2013‐2014, to monitor the health of NYC adults 20Â years or older. While blood pressure was measured in both surveys, an auscultatory mercury sphygmomanometer was used to measure blood pressure in clinics in 2004, and an oscillometric LifeSource UA‐789AC monitor was used in homes in 2013‐2014. To assess comparability of blood pressure results across both surveys, we undertook a randomized study comparing blood pressure (BP) readings by the two devices. Blood pressure measuring protocols followed the 2013 Association for the Advancement in Medical instrumentation guidelines for non‐invasive blood pressure device. Data from 167 volunteers were analyzed for this purpose.Paired t tests were used to test for significant difference in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure between devices for overall and by mid‐arm circumference categories. To test for systematic differences between the two devices, we generated Bland‐Altman graphs. Sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa statistics were calculated to assess between‐device agreement for high (â‰¥â€‰130/80Â mmHg) and not high (<â€‰130/80Â mmHg) blood pressure, with mercury set as the reference.Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured by LifeSource UA‐789AC were on average 2.0 and 1.1Â mmHg higher, respectively, than those of the mercury sphygmomanometer systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Sensitivity was 81%, specificity was 96%, and the Kappa coefficient was 75%. The Bland‐Altman graphs showed that the between‐device difference did not vary as a function of the average of the two devices for systolic blood pressure and was larger in the lower and upper ends for diastolic blood pressure. Given the observed differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings between the two blood pressure measurement approaches, we calibrated NYC HANES 2013‐2014 blood pressure data by predicting mercury blood pressure values from LifeSource blood pressure values. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in NYC HANES 2013‐2014 were lower when data were calibrated.

AB  -  We compared Telelab Personal Blood Pressure Transmitters to mercury sphygmomanometers on a random sample of 63 patients in an office setting and on 29 different patients in a home trial. Each patient was tested with the sphygmomanometer by one of two observers. Three consecutive measurements of each patient were averaged for each method. Although some differences between observers were statistically significant, they were not clinically significant. Differences between the two methods were well within the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation's accepted range for comparable medical equipment. The 29 hypertensive outpatients used the Telelab transmitter for periods ranging from 2 to 55 weeks during a clinical validation phase. The reliability and accuracy of the monitor were again demonstrated by frequent comparisons with office mercury sphygmomanometer measurements. The high degree of patient acceptance of the monitor for repeated readings over prolonged periods clearly adds to its usefulness.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Automated devices are widely available in the community for people to measure their blood pressure. We assessed the accuracy and reproducibility of a brand of community‐based automated device against the standard mercury sphygmomanometer. METHODS: Same‐arm pairs of blood pressure readings were obtained with the Vita‐Stat 90550 automated device, a sphygmomanometer and the Omron HEM‐705CP automated device in random order on volunteers in 3 community pharmacies using a modified protocol for evaluating blood pressure devices. Comparison of readings between the Omron device and the sphygmomanometer served as a positive control of how well a laboratory‐validated automated device could perform in the community. Both the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and British Hypertension Society (BHS) criteria were used to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of readings. RESULTS: The mean blood pressure reading and standard error (SE) of the mean for the 108 volunteers (66 women and 42 men) was 133/77 (SE 2/1) mm Hg with the Vita‐Stat device, 131/77 (SE 2/1) mm Hg with the Omron device and 129/76 (SE 2/1) mm Hg with the sphygmomanometer. The mean difference in readings was 4.4/1.0 (standard deviation [SD] 9.4/6.2) mm Hg between the Vita‐Stat device and the sphygmomanometer and 1.6/0.6 (SD 9.3/6.4) mm Hg between the Omron device and the sphygmomanometer. Neither automated device met the AAMI accuracy criteria for the systolic readings. The BHS grades were C/A (systolic unacceptable/diastolic acceptable) for each automated device. According to the BHS analytical criterion, all devices achieved acceptable reproducibility grades. INTERPRETATION: Neither automated device met the AAMI or BHS criteria for accuracy while in use in the community, and neither performed as well in the community as in the laboratory.

AB  -  Background: Less than 50% of patients with hypertensive disease manage to maintain their blood pressure (BP) within normal levels. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether cloud BP system integrated with computerized physician order entry (CPOE) can improve BP management as compared with traditional care. Methods: A randomized controlled trial done on a random sample of 382 adults recruited from 786 patients who had been diagnosed with hypertension and receiving treatment for hypertension in two district hospitals in the north of Taiwan. Physicians had access to cloud BP data from CPOE. Neither patients nor physicians were blinded to group assignment. The study was conducted over a period of seven months. Results: At baseline, the enrollees were 50% male with a mean (SD) age of 58.18 (10.83) years. The mean sitting BP of both arms was no different. The proportion of patients with BP control at two, four and six months was significantly greater in the intervention group than in the control group. The average capture rates of blood pressure in the intervention group were also significantly higher than the control group in all three check‐points. Conclusions: Cloud‐based BP system integrated with CPOE at the point of care achieved better BP control compared to traditional care. This system does not require any technical skills and is therefore suitable for every age group. The praise and assurance to the patients from the physicians after reviewing the Cloud BP records positively reinforced both BP measuring and medication adherence behaviors.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Hypertension and diabetes frequently coexist, which results in the difficulty of hypertension control in community‐dwelling elderly adults who lack effective prevention and control strategies. The aim of this study is to determine whether a combined pedometer and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) programme could improve blood pressure (BP) among community‐dwelling elderly adults with hypertension and diabetes. METHODS: The trial was a 2Ã—2 factorial randomised clinical trial that recruited 180 community‐dwelling elderly people (aged â‰¥60) with hypertension and diabetes in Tianjin, China. Participants were randomly assigned to control, pedometer, HBPM, and pedometer+HBPM groups. Intervention period was 12 months. The coprimary outcomes of the study were systolic and diastolic BP; the secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with controlled hypertension. BP was measured twice in the right arm using a mercurial sphygmomanometer. The mean of these two measurements was taken as the BP value. RESULTS: At 12 months, compared with the control group, the adjusted differences in least squares mean (95% CI) in systolic and diastolic BP changes for pedometer, HBPM, and pedometer+HBPM groups were ‐4.2 (‐8.4 to 0.1), ‐2.7 (‐6.9 to 1.5) and ‐8.1 (‐12.3 to ‐3.9)â€‰mm Hg (p<0.01); ‐3.2 (‐5.2 to ‐1.1), ‐0.1(‐2.1 to 1.9) and ‐3.6 (‐5.6 to ‐1.5)â€‰mm Hg (p<0.001), respectively; the adjusted difference in percentage (95%â€‰CI) in the controlled hypertension (BP <140/90â€‰mm Hg) for pedometer, HBPM and pedometer+HBPM groups were 7.5 (‐12.2 to 27.1), 9.9 (‐10.4 to 30.3) and 23.1 (5.0 to 41.1) (p=0.09). CONCLUSION: Combination pedometer and HBPM interventions can significantly decrease BP levels in elderly adults with hypertension and diabetes. TRIALS REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000021613.

AB  -  This study evaluated the accuracy and reliability of the Dinamap 8100 automated blood pressure machine against three internationally recognized criteria. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were taken concurrently by two nurses using the automated machine and a manual sphygmomanometer. Results demonstrated agreement between automated and manual readings on one set of criteria for both systolic and diastolic pressures, and support for systolic readings only on one other criterion. Comparison of mean differences between automated and manual measures showed the automated machine consistently under‐read both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The conclusion from this study was that the Dinamap 8100 machine can be used with some degree of confidence to assess systolic blood pressures in a general population of adult hospital inpatients, but with caution when taking diastolic readings.

AB  -  CONTEXT: Elevated blood pressure (BP) measured at the physician's office may reflect true hypertension or white coat hypertension (WCH). The prognostic value of WCH among pregnant women is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of WCH in pregnancy. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted between September 1994 and October 1997. SETTING: Community hospital. PATIENTS: Women without preexisting hypertension and not treated with antihypertensive drugs aid with high (n = 148) or normal (n = 106) office BP (high office BP was defined as > or =140 mm Hg systolic and/or > or =90 mm Hg diastolic) matched for gestational age during their third trimester of pregnancy. All women underwent 24‐hour noninvasive BP monitoring, and women without hypertension on 24‐hour monitoring (125/74 mm Hg or less for average 24‐hour BP) with office hypertension were classified as having WCH. Women were followed up through the end of pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Duration of pregnancy, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia or eclampsia, cesarean delivery, placental and neonatal weight, and length of maternal and neonatal hospital stays for those with and without elevated office BP. RESULTS: After application of exclusion criteria, data for 7 women were removed from the analysis. For the remaining subjects, in the group with elevated BP, prevalence of WCH was 29.2% (42/144). Duration of pregnancy was similar in the normotensive and WCH groups (39.6 vs 39.8 weeks; P = .50), but shorter (38.3 weeks; P<.001) in the true hypertension group. Incidence of preeclampsia was similar in the normotensive and WCH groups (5.8% vs 7.1 %; P = .86) but higher in the true hypertension group (61.7%; P<.001). Frequency of cesarean delivery was lower in the normotensive (12.4%) than in the WCH (45.2%; P = .008) and true hypertension (41.1 %; P = .009) groups. Neonatal weight was lower (P<.001) in the true hypertension (mean, 2911 g) than in the normotensive (3336 g) and WCH groups (3435 g), which did not differ (P = .68). The duration of neonatal hospital stay did not differ between the normotensive and the WCH group (5.3 vs 6.9 days; P = .13) but was longer in the true hypertension group (12.3 days; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In women with elevated BP during their third trimester of pregnancy, 24‐hour BP was superior to office BP (distinguishing true hypertension from WCH) for prediction of the outcome of pregnancy. Outcomes in the normotensive and WCH group were comparable, but the increased incidence of cesarean delivery in the WCH group may reflect decision‐making processes influenced by office BP.

AB  -  Introduction: Aldosterone induces vascular fibrosis and increases arterial stiffness (AS) of conductance arteries via mineralocorticoid‐receptor (MR) activation. In uncomplicated essential hypertensive patients (EHs) we measured systemic AS at baseline and after chronic administration of MR‐antagonist Canrenone. Methods: Twenty EHs (age 50 ± 12 years, M/F = 15/10, clinic BP 159/87 ± 2.4/2.2) on chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II antagonist plus hydrochlorothiazide at maximal doses, were randomly assigned to Canrenone 50 or 100 mg/day for 3 months. Blood pressure (BP, sphygmomanometer), heart rate (HR, EKG), stroke volume index (SVI, impedance cardiography) were measured in supine patients before and after Canrenone. AS was assessed as the ratio of pulse pressure (PP) to SVI. Results: Canrenone decreased PP (from 68.7 ± 2.9 to 51.9 ± 2.9 mmHg, means ± sem, P<0.01) without affecting SVI (33.2 ± 1.4 vs 31.5 ± 1.4 ml/m2) and HR (64.4 ± 1.9 vs 65.5 ± 2.2 bt/min). Thus, AS decreased from 2.14 ± 0.13 to 1.70 ± 0.12 mmHg/ml/m2 (Figure 15), the decrements induced by low and high canrenone dose being not different (‐0.49 ± 0.11 vs‐0.39 ± 0.19 mmHg/ml/m2, respectively). Conclusions: Chronic treatment with MR‐antagonist canrenone decreases systemic arterial stiffness in uncomplicated EHs; this effect may improve cardiovascular risk profile in these subjects (Figure Presented).

AB  -  Hypertension is a major public health problem for the elderly, affecting more than 16 million Americans 65 years and older. Physical activity, a lifestyle behavior, has been shown to reduce blood pressure in sedentary, hypertensive, elderly individuals. This randomized, controlled, clinical trial assessed the effect of an unsupervised, self‐paced, moderate‐intensity walking program on blood pressure in underactive, elderly persons with untreated, stage 1 hypertension. Thirty‐two healthy volunteers (21 women, 11 men) completed the three‐month study. Eighteen subjects (12 women, six men) walked at their own pace in their communities using Borg's ratings of perceived exertion scale (RPE) to monitor their walking intensity five days a week for 12 weeks. Energy expenditure increased from approximately 1000 kcal/wk to $>$2000 kcal/wk, on average. Nine women and five men in the control group received no treatment during the study. Blood pressure was measured weekly with a Tycos aneroid sphygmomanometer. Using repeated‐measures analysis of variance, heart rate, body weight, and blood pressure were comparable between groups at baseline. By the third week, the blood pressure lowering effect of walking became statistically significant and was maintained for the duration of the study. In contrast, no statistically significant changes in blood pressure were noted among subjects in the control group over the course of the study. There were no statistically significant gender effects or changes in body weight, heart rate, or dietary intake over time in either group. In conclusion, this community‐based walking intervention produced a statistically and clinically significant decrease in blood pressure among sedentary, older adults with stage 1 hypertension who walked. These data further suggest that, in this population, the average weekly energy expended through walking reaches a level for which measurable health benefits are known to occur.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Hypertension is known as one of the most important non‐communicable pervasive diseases. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of a mobile‐based educational app on the blood pressure (BP) of patients with hypertension. METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted on 66 military personnel who were definitively diagnosed with hypertension by a physician, and then assigned randomly into two groups as intervention (receiving mobile‐based educational app) and control (receiving standard medical management but no app). Before the intervention, BP levels of both groups were measured with a calibrated sphygmomanometer. After 6 weeks, the BPs of both groups were remeasured using the same sphygmomanometer. Thereafter, descriptive and inferential statistics, including paired t‐test, Mann‐Whitney, Chi‐square and Wilcoxon tests, were used. The data obtained were analysed using SPSS‐21 software at a significance level of p<0.05. RESULTS: Comparison of the intervention and control groups showed no statistically significant difference between the groups in systolic BP (p=0.479) and diastolic BP (p=0.851) in the pre‐intervention phase, but after the intervention, systolic and diastolic BP levels were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: The results suggested that the mobile‐based educational app had a significant effect on reducing BP in patients with hypertension. Therefore, using this app is recommended for those military personnel with hypertension.

AB  -  The study was conducted to estimate the frequency of white coat hypertension, ie, hypertension when in contact with the doctor only, in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. We studied 159 consecutive patients (median age 47 years, 86 women) referred from primary health care to a hypertension clinic. For all patients, their general practitioner had decided to treat the hypertension pharmacologically, but the treatment had not yet begun. The blood pressure measurements reported from the referring doctors were 164.1 +/‐ 18.1/104.3 +/‐ 7.1 mm Hg (mean +/‐ SD). Measured at the hypertension clinic with random zero sphygmomanometer the pressures were 156.8 +/‐ 22.5/99.8 +/‐ 11.7 mm Hg. The indirectly measured day‐time ambulatory blood pressures were 145.2 +/‐ 18.1/95.9 +/‐ 11.5 mm Hg. When a cut‐off level of 90 mm Hg diastolic was applied, all patients were considered hypertensive by the referring doctors' measurements; the random zero office measurements regarded 18.3% of the patients as normotensive. The ambulatory measurements regarded a further 24.8% as normotensive (white coat hypertensive), whereas five patients considered normotensive by office measurements were hypertensive when evaluated by ambulatory monitoring (reverse white coat phenomenon). The difference between systolic office measurements and the daytime ambulatory blood pressures was significantly larger for female patients; age was positively correlated and weight negatively correlated to this difference. No significant difference was found for the diastolic measurements. It is concluded that white coat hypertension is present in approximately a quarter of the patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. By implementing ambulatory monitoring in clinical practice some of the overdiagnosing will possibly be avoided, but further studies on the subject are needed.

AB  -  Objective: Office blood pressure measurements taken using automated devices (AOBP) are being increasingly used in clinical practice. This study compared unattended versus attended AOBP when the same device and measurement protocol is used. Design and method: Untreated or treated subjects attending an outpatient hypertension clinic were subjected to unattended and attended AOBP measurements (randomized order; 2 separate visits on 2 consecutive days; triplicate sitting measurements after 5‐min rest; Microlife WatchBP Office professional oscillometric device) and 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring (Microlife WatchBP O3). Results: 113 subjects were analyzed (mean age 60.9 Â± 13.4 years, 54% males, 60% treated hypertensives; 25% smokers; 11% diabetics; 7% with cardiovascular disease). Unattended systolic AOBP was slightly lower than attended AOBP, with no difference in diastolic AOBP (unattended AOBP 128 Â± 16.2/78.4 Â± 11.8 mmHg, systolic/diastolic, mean difference ‐2.2 Â± 10.8/‐0.5 Â± 8.3 mmHg, p = 0.04/ NS). The attended‐unattended systolic AOBP difference was correlated with attended systolic AOBP (r = 0.41, p < 0.01) but not with age. Subjects with attended systolic AOBP > = 140 mmHg had higher attended minus unattended systolic AOBP difference compared to those with lower systolic AOBP (7.4 Â± 10.8 vs. ‐0.1 Â± 10.1 mmHg respectively, p < 0.01). The attended‐unattended AOBP was similar in treated hypertensives and untreated subjects (3.2 Â± 11.7 vs. 1.2 Â± 9.2 mmHg, p = NS), or in men and women (3.2 Â± 11.4 vs. 0.8 Â± 10.1 mmHg, p = NS). Daytime ABP did not differ from unattended and attended AOBP (difference 0.5 Â± 12.3/‐0.6 Â± 9.1 mmHg, systolic/diastolic vs. unattended and ‐1.7 Â± 14.2/‐1.1 Â± 8.9 mmHg vs attended AOBP, p = NS for all). Conclusions: These data suggest that when standardized triplicate AOBP measurements are obtained, there is no difference between unattended and attended measurements provided that the same device and measurement protocol is used. However, at office BP levels >140/90 mmHg attended AOBP may be higher than unattended measurements.

AB  -  Objective: To determine the effect of foot massage on reducing blood pressure in patients with intradialytic hypertension. Method: This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Subjects were 32 hemodialyses (HD) patients randomly allocated into two groups: the control group and the intervention group. Foot massage was performed three times in intradialytic phase for 5–10 min in the first, second, and third HD hours. Measurement of blood pressure (BP) used portable sphygmomanometer. The measurement was conducted every hour. Results: There is a different effect of foot massage on systolic and diastole blood pressure between the control group and intervention group with p < 0.05. The difference in median value for systolic blood pressure between the two groups was 25 mmHg, and diastole was 10 mmHg. Conclusion: The foot massage is beneficial in controlling intradialytic hypertension and can be applied in the management of hemodialysis patients by nurses.

AB  -  Two frequently used automated, blood pressure monitors, the Arteriosonde and the Dinamap, were compared with each other and with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. Fifteen patients with elevated blood pressure were studied: 5 were untreated, 5 received a diuretic alone, and 5 received a beta blocker alone. One hundred and twenty blood pressure measurements were taken from each subject with two different instruments (one on each arm) in a 2 (supine or standing position) x 2 (left or right arm) x 3 (three different sets of pairwise instrument comparisons) x 5 (five one‐minute interval measurements per phase) factorial design. A reasonable inter‐instrument comparability for systolic blood pressure was found with mean deviations of +1.3 mmHg and ‐3.8 mmHg from the mercury sphygmomanometer for the Dinamap and Arteriosonde, respectively. Differences between instruments for diastolic pressure however, were significantly larger. The Arteriosonde systematically obtained higher diastolic pressure values (+7.4 mmHg) than the mercury sphygmomanometer or the Dinamap (10.7 mmHg). Diastolic pressure on the Dinamap was on average 5.2 mmHg lower than on the mercury sphygmomanometer. Left/right arm differences and differences for the treatment conditions were not observed. Findings clearly suggest that these two automated blood pressure monitors cannot be used interchangeably with each other or with the mercury sphygmomanometer in either a research or clinical setting. Overall the Dinamap approached mercury sphygmomanometer measures more closely than did the Arteriosonde. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: Investigators: The study investigator: A PhD candidate who has been trained to use the VMax machine and undertake the respiratory function tests required to calibrate the IMT device. The study investigator will also demonstrate/ train study participants on how to use their IMT devices. In addition, the study investigator has also been trained to perform all autonomic and hemodynamic tests in this study. Sleep Physician: The Principal Investigator is a sleep physician who will be responsible for the recruitment of suitable study candidates. Recruitment: Participants presenting to a sleep clinic (Royal North Shore Hospital) will be approached for recruitment by the treating sleep physician. The inclusion criteria dictate that all patients selected for recruitment will have a history of hypertension and OSA. Visits: All face‐to‐face study visits will take place at The Charles Perkins Centre, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Clinic, University of Sydney Study visits: Visit 1 (5 minutes): Participants to provide formal written consent before they are randomised to receive High or low‐Intensity Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) using Threshold IMT (Philips Respironics, Sussex, UK). Visit 2 (30 minutes): A face‐to‐face visit with the study investigator will be undertaken where the participant will be set‐up with 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure (15 minutes). They will return this device the following day. An e‐mail will be sent with a link to Questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and SF‐36 Short Form Health Survey) that will require completion the same night at home (15 minutes). Visit 3 (1.5 hour): The morning following visit 2 the blood pressure monitor will be returned. The study investi CONDITION: Cardiovascular ‐ Hypertension Obstructive Sleep Apnea;Hypertension; ; Obstructive Sleep Apnea ; Hypertension Respiratory ‐ Sleep apnoea PRIMARY OUTCOME: Blood pressure:; This outcome will be measured using a sphygmomanometer. The Oscar 2™ Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor from SunTech Medical® will be used to assess 24‐hour blood pressure. This is the gold standard in 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).[Before the commencement of treatment (Visit 2, Week 1) and upon completion of the trial period (Visit 5, Week 6)] SECONDARY OUTCOME: Autonomic function: ; Continuous blood pressure waveform and ECG will be recorded for 10 minutes in the supine position, using the Human Non‐Invasive Blood Pressure System (NIBP). The Human NIBP system accurately determines beat‐to‐beat blood pressure, enabling assessment of autonomic cardiovascular control such as spontaneous baroreflex function, and blood pressure variability. The human NIBP system operates via a photoplethysmographic cuff (blood pressure cuff with an infrared sensitive photocell), a pressure manometer, an automatic unit for cuff inflation, a 3‐lead ECG and a monitor for the digital display of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. The finger cuff is designed for the adult finger with an automated calibration device attached to the cuff which maintains constant transmural pressure on the finger. Therefore, assessment of autonomic function will be derived from the recorded blood pressure. An ECG will be undertaken simultaneously which will be used to derive heart rate variability. ; [Before the commencement of treatment (Visit 2, Week 1) and upon completion of the trial period (Visit 5, Week 6)] Pulse Wave Velocity: ; The SphygmoCor XCEL system enables the non‐invasive measurement of pulse wave velocity of the blood pressure waveform travelling between two arterial sites. Measurements will be performed by recording pressure waveforms at the carotid artery followed by the femoral artery using a tonometer pressure sensor along with ECG signal recorded simultaneously. The SphygmoCor XCEL system also enables us to assess peripheral arterial stiffness as an output using the augmentation index. ; [Before the commencement of treatment (Visit 2, Week 1) and upon completion of the trial period (Visit 5, Week 6)] INCLUSION CRITERIA: • Participants presenting to a sleep clinic (Royal North Shore Hospital) • Adults (male and female) • Willingness to undergo IMT for 6 weeks. • Willingness to provide informed consent and willingness to participate and comply with the study requirements.

AB  -  Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of two commercial brands of bisoprolol â€“hydrochlorothiazide as antihypertensive therapy. Method: A prospective, double blind, double placebo, randomised, parallel group study was conducted, in which the antihypertensive effect of the bisoprolol â€“hydrochlorothiazide 2.5 ‐ 6.25 mg and 5 ‐ 6.25 mg (tablets BHL, test formula) and bisoprolol ‐hydrochlorothiazide 2.5 ‐ 6.25 mg and 5 ‐ 6.25 mg tablets (BHM, reference formula), was compared by administering it to patients with arterial hypertension given to patients with arterial hypertension. Effectivity variables: blood pressures measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer at the beginning and after the placebo period, at 4 weeks and 8 weeks from the start of the treatment; blood pressure hours change during 24 hours using an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device. Results: Control of the blood pressure values was achieved with both formulas, mainly from the fourth week of treatment. The patients of the test group were admitted with higher systolic blood pressures. After the treatment, there were no differences between the groups at any of the times. The V/P ratio of the test group was 0.5 â€“ 1. The smoothness index in both groups was greater than 1.75 of fit of both was greater than 1.75. Conclusions: The test formula of the bisoprolol‐hydrochlorothiazide demonstrated an antihypertensive action similar to that achieved with the reference formula.

AB  -  To determine whether a semi‐automatic oscillometric blood pressure (BP) monitor Dinamap 1846SX (DIN) can replace the standard mercury sphygmomanometer (SMS) for BP measurements in diabetic patients and their offspring, we compared SMS with DIN in 105 diabetic patients and their families. Their mean age was 50.6 (range 24‐86) years, of whom 41 had diabetes mellitus (DM), 32 impaired glucose tolerance and 32 non‐DM. After resting quietly for 10 min, their right arm BP were measured twice with each device at random and with 1‐min intervals between each measurement. Agreement between measurements was tested by plotting the differences between the methods against means and by intraclass correlation coefficient (r(I)). The DIN was also evaluated by the criteria of American Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), the British Hypertension Society (BHS) criteria and clinical criteria of O'Brien. All measurements by DIN [first readings or averaged readings of duplicate measurements of systolic BP (SBP) or diastolic BP (DBP)] satisfied the AAMI criteria and had good agreement with SMS (r(I)=. 951 for SBP and r(I)=.905 for DBP). The first readings of systolic BP measured by DIN vs. SMS failed to satisfy the criteria by O'Brien and reached BHS grade C level. Other measurements passed the limits of O'Brien and reached BHS grade A or B. In conclusion, averaged readings of duplicate BP measurements by DIN are interchangeable with that by SMS in Chinese diabetic patients and their offspring. Only one single DIN measurement is not acceptable for clinical application.

AB  -  Background and objectives: Background and Objectives: Data on the potential beneficial effects of supplementation of vitamin D in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypovitaminosis D are still scarce. The aim of study was to evaluate the effect of a single dose (100.000 IU) of vitamin D on 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in patients with type 2 DM, hypovitaminosis D and hypertension. Methods: In a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, 43 hypertensive patients with type 2 DM and hypovitaminosis D were randomly assigned to vitamin D supplement group (single dose 100,000 IU) or placebo group (single dose). Blood pressure (BP) was assessed by office measurements (Omron HEM‐705CP) and 24‐h ABPM (Spacelabs®). Physical activity was evaluated by steps counter (pedometer‐Yamax Digi‐Walker®). Clinical, nutritional, and laboratory parameters were evaluated by a standardized protocol before and after the supplementation. Body composition was determinate by bioimpendance In Body®. Results were expressed as mean, median, or number of patients with the characteristic. Changes in variables during the study were analyzed by the general linear model (GLM) for repeated measures. Results: Forty‐three 43 patients (age 65.4±9.2 years; 35% males; BMI 30.6±4.4 kg/m2, DM duration 12.4±7.7 years; HbA1c 7.6±1.0%) were included. Mean 25(OH)D was 14.1±4.4 ng/ml. Office systolic and diastolic BP were 147.0±17.0 and 82.8±6.8 mmHg, in placebo group and 148.9±18.1 and 84.2±13.7 mmHg in intervention group. After eight weeks, supplementation of vitamin D caused ABPM reduction on systolic 24‐h (‐5.1vs.‐0.9 mm Hg; P=0.025), systolic daytime (‐6.3 vs.‐0.3 mm Hg; P=0.004), and diastolic daytime (‐4.9vs.‐0.1 mm Hg; P=0.006) and office systolic BP (‐6.3 vs.‐3.4 mm Hg; P <0.001) measurements than observed in the control group. Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation in patients who had hypovitaminosis caused a clinically significant reductions in systolic office BP and ABPM values in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes.

AB  -  Arterial hypertension is the most common cardiovascular risk factor in the elderly. Its clinical control emphasises the problem of the systems used for monitoring: clinical measurement by the physician, home self‐monitoring, ambulatory monitoring, etc. In particular, in the elderly population, the self‐monitoring of blood pressure can present further problems associated with their situation. In our study we evaluated, in an elderly population, the differences in the self‐recording of blood pressure with automatic and semi‐automatic equipment using a mercury sphygmomanometer by a physician as a 'gold standard' control. We studied 28 elderly subjects using a rigid protocol for the self‐measurement of their blood pressure. Our results show that automatic equipment is significantly more precise and easier to use than semiautomatic equipment in home self‐measurement of blood pressure in elderly people.

AB  -  The practice of hot yoga is becoming widespread as marked by a growing number of yoga studios offering classes in heated rooms ranging in temperature from 27 to 41Â°C. Previous research has shown reductions in ambulatory blood pressure (BP) with thermoneutral (nonheated) yoga interventions; however, to date, no studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of hot yoga in hypertension (HTN). The purpose of this ongoing trial is to determine whether hot yoga can reduce ambulatory BP, augmentation index (AIx), and perceived stress in unmedicated adults with elevated BP and stage I HTN. Sedentary men and women (ages 20‐65yrs) were enrolled if the averages of 3 seated BP measurements were within the elevated BP (120‐129 mmHg for systolic with a diastolic <80 mmHg) or stage I HTN (130‐139 mmHg for systolic or 80‐89 mmHg for diastolic BP) ranges at two separate visits. Twenty‐four hours of ambulatory BP monitoring was completed prior to randomization to the yoga or control groups. Yoga group participants (n=5) completed 3 60min Bikram yoga classes (40.5Â°C) and the control group (n=5) was instructed not to change their physical activity for 12 weeks. AIx and perceived stress were assessed using the SphygmoCor and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Most study participants were African‐American (n=3) or Hispanic/Latinx (n=3) and no adverse events occurred. Twenty‐four‐hour systolic (126Â±17 to 121Â±14 mmHg; p=0.01) and diastolic (82Â±12 to 79Â±12 mmHg; p=0.04) BPs and PSS scores (14Â±9 to 10Â±6; p=0.047) were reduced following the yoga intervention. When comparing waking versus sleeping BPs according to subjects' reported sleep times, only waking systolic (129Â±15 to 122Â±15 mmHg; p=0.016) and diastolic (85Â±11 to 81Â±12 mmHg; p = 0.024) BPs declined while no changes in sleeping BPs were detected in the yoga group. AIx (23% to 21%; p =0.58) and body mass were unaltered following the yoga intervention and no outcome variable changed in the control group. Preliminary results support the safety and efficacy of hot yoga in improving ambulatory BP and reducing mental stress, a correlate of HTN, in adults with elevated BP and stage I HTN. These BP reductions were observed in the absence of BP medications or weight loss, and do not appear to be associated with improvements in pulse wave analysis.

AB  -  Background Several ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) measures have been associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk independent of clinic blood pressure (BP). African Americans have higher clinic BP compared with Whites but few data are available on racial differences in ABPM measures. Methods We compared ABPM measures between African American (n = 178) and White (n = 103) participants at the Year 5 Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study visit. BP was measured during a study visit and the second and third measurements were averaged. ABPM was conducted over the following 24 hours. Results Mean +/‐ SD age of participants was 29.8 +/‐ 3.8 years and 30.8 +/‐ 3.5 years for African Americans and Whites, respectively. Mean daytime systolic BP (SBP) was 3.90 (SD 1.18) mm Hg higher among African Americans compared with Whites (P < 0.001) after age‐gender adjustment and 1.71 (SD 1.03) mm Hg higher after multivariable adjustment including mean clinic SBP (P = 0.10). After multivariable adjustment including mean clinic SBP, nighttime SBP was 4.83 (SD 1.11) mm Hg higher among African Americans compared with Whites (P < 0.001). After multivariable adjustment, the African Americans were more likely than Whites to have nocturnal hypertension (prevalence ratio: 2.44, 95% CI: 0.99‐6.05) and nondipping (prevalence ratio: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.39‐4.48). The prevalence of masked hypertension among African Americans and Whites was 4.4% and 2.1%, respectively, (P = 0.49) and white coat hypertension was 3.3% and 3.9%, respectively (P = 0.99). Twenty‐four hour BP variability on ABPM was higher among African Americans compared with Whites. Conclusions These data suggest racial differences in several ABPM measures exist.

AB  -  It is presently unknown whether there are sex differences in the magnitude of blood pressure (BP) responses to baroreceptor perturbation or if the relative contribution of cardiac output (CO) and total vascular conductance (TVC) to baroreflex‐mediated changes in BP differs in young women and men. Since sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone is attenuated in women, we hypothesized that carotid baroreflex‐mediated BP responses would be attenuated in women by virtue of a blunted vascular response (i.e., an attenuated TVC response). BP, heart rate (HR), and stroke volume were continuously recorded during the application of 5‐s pulses of neck pressure (NP; carotid hypotension) and neck suction (NS; carotid hypertension) ranging from +40 to ‐80 Torr in women (n = 20, 21 ± 0.5 yr) and men (n = 20, 21 ± 0.4 yr). CO and TVC were calculated on a beat‐to‐beat basis. Women demonstrated greater depressor responses to NS (e.g., ‐60 Torr, ‐17 ± 1%baseline in women vs. ‐11 ± 1%baseline in men, P < 0.05), which were driven by augmented decreases in HR that, in turn, contributed to larger reductions in CO (‐60 Torr, ‐15 ± 2%baseline in women vs. ‐6 ± 2%baseline in men, P < 0.05). In contrast, pressor responses to NP were similar in women and men (e.g., +40 Torr, +14 ± 2%baseline in women vs. +10 ± 1%baseline in men, P > 0.05), with TVC being the primary mediating factor in both groups. Our findings indicate that sex differences in the baroreflex control of BP are evident during carotid hypertension but not carotid hypotension. Furthermore, in contrast to our hypothesis, young women exhibited greater BP responses to carotid hypertension by virtue of a greater cardiac responsiveness.

AB  -  Sixty singleton pregnant women, diagnosed with gestational hypertension (GH) at 21‐ week of gestation, and aged between 25‐35 years were randomized. GH was defined as blood pressure higher than 140/90 measured on two separate occasions, more than 6 hours apart, without the presence of protein in the urine and diagnosed after 20 weeks of gestation. Women with multiple pregnancies, cervical insufficiency, vaginal bleeding, heart disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, kidney failure, and neurologic disorders were excluded from the study. For inclusion in the study, pregnant women also could not be engaged in any supervised physical exercise, at the time of selection and when signing a free written informed consent term. Pregnant women were randomized using an opaque sealed envelope that was sequentially numbered and statistically generated by a computer program. The envelope contained information about the random allocation group: group (A), engaged in aerobic exercise twice a week under the supervision of a physical therapist, and group (B), engaged in device guided breathing exercises. Both groups received antihypertensive medications. Random allocation of the subjects was performed by another investigator, who did not participate directly in the research study. Exercise program for group (A) The therapist advised all participants to drink a plenty of water before and after the exercise session to avoid excessive loss of body water during the session. Pregnant women were instructed to have a light meal about one hour before the performance of exercise and to wear comfortable clothes. Participants in this group were given a Low‐Intensity Aerobic Exercise with Borg scale RPE at 11. Participants were asked to maintain this intensity of rate of perceived exertion throughout the 45 minutes' duration of the aerobic training. During the training session, the therapist stood near the patient to observe and detect signs of stopping the exercise. The therapist continuously asked the patient if she felt pain, dizzy or shortens of breath. Device guided breathing for group (B) The FDA approved the Resperate device as an adjunct anti‐hypertensive treatment approach that guides home users to alter their breathing rate in response to instructed signals . At the beginning the researcher explained the device and study procedures to every participant of group (B).The device consists of a control box, headphones and a respiratory rate monitor attached as a sensor belt around the user's chest. The participant is instructed to alter their breathing rate, aiming for up to 10 breaths per minute, in response to a melody played to them via the asked to use the device for at least 40 min per week, with each session lasting at least 10 min . All pregnant females of both groups were requested to maintain routine lifestyle habits with regard to diet intake throughout the study. All blood pressure measurements were conducted during the morning hours. Arterial blood pressure was measured using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer with appropriate cuff size, after subjects had rested in the sitting position for at least 5 minutes. BP was measured and presented at 20 week gestation and week‐36 of gestation. Two readings were taken at 2 minutes interval, and the average values were used as the baseline value.

AB  -  Objective: This study aimed to investigate association between social support and hypertension (HTN)control in rural China older adults, and to what extent depression mediates this relationship. The authors hypothesized that depression severity mediated the relationship between social support and HTN control. Methods: Data for the analyses were obtained from baseline data from a randomized controlled clinical trial of a collaborative depression care management intervention conducted in rural villages of China, with older adults with comorbid depression and HTN. Data included baseline assessments of 2,351 subjects aged 60 years and older, whose blood pressure and depression severity were measured using a calibrated manual sphygmomanometer and the 17‐item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS‐17), respectively. Social support was measured using the 20‐item Medical Outcomes Study–Social Support Survey. Results: Uncontrolled HTN was associated with older age (t[df = 2349]= 3.16; p < 0.01), higher HDRS‐17 score (t[df = 1488]= 5.89; p < 0.001), and lower social support (t[df = 2349]= 5.37; p < 0.001). A significant indirect effect of social support via depression severity in relation to HTN control (a × b = –0.04[0.01]), bootstrap p = 0.0015, and 95% confidence interval (–0.07, –0.02), accounting for 11% of the effect of social support on HTN control. Conclusion: These findings imply that social support impacts HTN control directly and indirectly through depression. Intervention approaches such as primary care‐based collaborative care models should address social support to achieve greater outcomes for depression and HTN management.

AB  -  Blood pressure measurement with two automatic devices, Dinamap 845 and Sentry, was compared with the standard mercury sphygmomanometer, by means of a 3‐period crossover experiment. Both automatic devices read diastolic pressure considerably lower than the mercury sphygmomanometer (about 7 mmHg on average); agreement was better for systolic pressure. Device differences in individual patients were often much higher. To assess the patient's emotional pressor response during manual measurement, Dinamap was used to monitor blood pressure before, during and after measurement with the mercury sphygmomanometer. No rise in pressure was found. It is concluded that the three devices can often give different values, and that the physician's involvement cannot explain these differences.

AB  -  Cardiovascular reactivity is the change in blood pressure, pulse, and other parameters of cardiovascular function in response to a challenging task. During the conduct of cardiovascular reactivity protocols, researchers frequently use automated blood pressure devices to measure blood pressure reactivity. However, the accuracy of automated devices in measuring blood pressure reactivity is unknown. To investigate the accuracy and precision of the Dinamap 1846 SXP and the VitaStat 2600B in the measurement of blood pressure reactivity, we compared blood pressure reactivity recorded by the VitaStat and Dinamap with that obtained by observers using a conventional mercury sphygmomanometer. At three sites, 159 normotensive subjects performed the same task twice, once with blood pressure reactivity measured by the manual observers and once by the VitaStat (n = 79) or Dinamap (n = 80), with the order determined at random. Ratios (VitaStat/Dinamap) of aggregate within‐person variance for baseline and task, systolic and diastolic blood pressures ranged from 1.53 to 4.93 (all P < 0.01), suggesting that the Dinamap has better precision than the VitaStat. For both diastolic and systolic blood pressure reactivity and for both types of automated devices, the mean differences in blood pressure reactivity between manual and automated measurements were small (range, ‐1.8 to 0.8 mm Hg). However, the VitaStat versus manual scatter plot of diastolic blood pressure reactivity showed greater dispersion (correlation coefficient r = 0.16, P = 0.15) than the Dinamap versus manual scatter plot (r = 0.36, P = 0.001). For systolic blood pressure reactivity, the VitaStat versus manual and Dinamap versus manual scatter plots were similar. Our data indicate that the Dinamap is superior to the VitaStat in the measurement of blood pressure reactivity. The substantial performance differences between the VitaStat and Dinamap suggest that other automated blood pressure monitors must be evaluated prior to use in cardiovascular reactivity studies.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Although they have been marketed widely, few data about the diagnostic accuracy of blood pressure monitors are available. METHODS: Repeated measurements of blood pressures in 85 patients were performed in random sequence with two oscillometric blood pressure monitors around the upper arm (Visomat OZ2) and the wrist (Omron R3( and with a standard sphygmomanometer. The oscillometric blood pressure monitors were validated according to protocols of the British Hypertension Society (BHS) and the American Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Subsequently, sensitivity and specificity of these monitors for the diagnosis of hypertension or exclusion of the possibility of its presence in a general medical outpatient population were calculated. RESULTS: Sphygmomanometric readings exceeded oscillometric blood pressure measurements by 3.7+/‐7.5/4.8+/‐5.6 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) for the upper arm and 5.7+/‐6.2/6.8+/‐6.8 mmHg for the wrist. Deviations occurred in both directions and were higher for blood pressures in the hypertensive range. Oscillometric blood pressure measurements at the upper arm, but not at the wrist, satisfied validation criteria of BHS and AAMI protocols. Optimal sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of hypertension, defined as blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg with a standard sphygmomanometer, was achieved with blood pressure limits of 133/82 mmHg for the Visomat OZ and 131/80 mmHg for the Omron R3. CONCLUSIONS: Average sphygmomanometer values exceed oscillometrically measured blood pressure values but individual disagreements cannot be predicted. Measurements at the upper arm are more accurate than are those at the wrist according to the validation protocols of the BHS and AAMI. Additional appraisal of sensitivities and specificities and of a 'range of uncertainty' for the diagnosis of hypertension may allow better judgement of accuracy of individual oscillometric blood pressure measurements.

AB  -  This study was conducted to compare the accuracy of clinic blood pressure (CBP) and telemedical home blood pressure (HBP) measurement in the diagnosis of hypertension in primary care. The study subjects were 411 patients with average CBP ≥140 mmHg systolic or ≥90 mmHg diastolic, who performed telemedical HBP measurement (5 days, four times daily) and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring in random order. Main outcome measure was the agreement of CBP and HBP with daytime ABP. CBP was much higher than daytime ABP and average HBP (P < 0.001) with no difference between the latter two. The correlation between CBP and ABP was weak (systolic: r = 0.499, diastolic: r = 0.543), whereas strong correlations existed between HBP and ABP (systolic: r = 0.847, diastolic: r = 0.812). A progressive improvement in the strength of the linear regression between average HBP of single days and ABP was obtained from day 1 to day 4, with no further benefit obtained on the fifth day. The HBP readings taken at noon and in the afternoon showed significantly stronger correlations with ABP than the blood pressures measured in the morning and in the evening. In conclusion, the accuracy of telemedical HBP measurement was substantially better than that of CBP in the diagnosis of hypertension in primary care. HBP most accurately reflected ABP on the fourth day of monitoring, and the readings at noon and in the afternoon seemed to be most accurate.

AB  -  To determine if the calcium channel blocking agent, nitrendipine, is effective as monotherapy we have performed a double‐blind placebo‐controlled crossover trial using 20 mg once daily or twice daily in 19 mild to moderate hypertensive patients. Blood pressure was measured by a random zero (RZ) sphygmomanometer and at home using the Remler semiautomatic BP recorder. The BP (RZ) was significantly reduced by twice daily nitrendipine compared to placebo (from 163/99 +/‐ 20/6 mmHg to 140/90 +/‐ 15/9 mmHg). Once daily drug administration reduced systolic BP only (163 +/‐ 20 to 144 +/‐ 17 mmHg). Remler BP confirmed that the maximum systolic and diastolic BP lowering effect was in the twice daily group while once daily drug did produce a significant lowering of BP but less than the twice daily dosage. This study suggests that twice daily nitrendipine caused a greater decrease in BP and was more consistent than once a day. The emergence of a new generation of automatic BP recorders should improve the evaluation of once daily therapeutic agents.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: To check the validation of the precision in measuring arterial pressure (AP) of an automatic non‐invasive machine for out‐patient monitoring of arterial pressure, the ACP‐2200, comparing the sequential with the simultaneous method in line with the criteria of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. DESIGN: A comparative crossover study. SETTING: Primary Care. "La Orden" Health Centre, Huelva. PATIENTS: 86 individuals, 42 men and 44 women of all ages, both hypertense and not, and without any antihypertension treatment, with SAP intervals between 99 and 160 mmHg and DAP between 59 and 105 mmHg, selected at random from the on‐demand consultations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three AP readings were made with a manual apparatus for reference (a mercury sphygmomanometer) and three simultaneously with the ACP‐2200 and the manual apparatus placed in a T on the cuff. The AP means obtained were compared and the mean calculated. The standard deviations of the paired differences between the APs obtained with the ACP‐2200 and with the manual method, both in the sequential and simultaneous form, as well as Pearson's lineal correlation coefficient, were all calculated. The means of the paired differences and the standard deviations between the automatic and manual apparatuses were, for the SAP, 1.52 +/‐ 4 (r = 0.96) and 0.66 +/‐ 3.38 (r = 0.97) (sequential and simultaneous, respectively) and, for the DAP, 0.86 +/‐ 2.84 (r = 0.98) and 0.64 +/‐ 1.73 (r = 0.99) (sequential and simultaneous, respectively). All the values of p were inferior to 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: The ACP‐2200 complies with the validation criteria for the two methods used, with the simultaneous method being recommended for use.

AB  -  Objective: Aldosterone induces vascular fibrosis and increases arterial stiffness (AS) of conductance arteries via mineralocorticoid‐receptor (MR) activation. In uncomplicated essential hypertensives (EHs) we measured systemic AS at baseline and after chronic administration of MR‐antagonist Canrenone. Design and method: Twenty EHs (age 50 ± 12 yrs, M/F = 15/10, clinic BP 159/87 ± 2.4/2.2) on chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II antagonist plus hydrochlorothiazide at maximal doses, were randomly assigned to Canrenone 50 or 100 mg/day for 3 months. Blood pressure (BP, sphygmomanometer), heart rate (HR, EKG), stroke volume index (SVI, impedance cardiography) were measured in supine patients before and after Canrenone. AS was assessed as the ratio of pulse pressure (PP) to SVI. Results: Canrenone decreased PP (from 68.7 ± 2.9 to 51.9 ± 2.9 mmHg, means ± sem, p < 0.01) without affecting SVI (33.2 ± 1.4 vs 31.5 ± 1.4 ml/m2) and HR (64.4 ± 1.9 vs 65.5 ± 2.2 bt/min). Thus, AS decreased from 2.14 ± 0.13 to 1.70 ± 0.12 mmHg/ml/m2 (Figure), the decrements induced by low and high canrenone dose being not different (‐0.49 ± 0.11 vs ‐0.39 ± 0.19 mmHg/ml/m2, respectively). Conclusions: Chronic treatment with MR‐antagonist Canrenone decreases systemic arterial stiffness in uncomplicated EHs; this effect may improve cardiovascular risk profile in these subjects.

AB  -  Consumption of flavanol‐rich dark chocolate (DC) has been shown to decrease blood pressure (BP) and insulin resistance in healthy subjects, suggesting similar benefits in patients with essential hypertension (EH). Therefore, we tested the effect of DC on 24‐hour ambulatory BP, flow‐mediated dilation (FMD), and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) in patients with EH. After a 7‐day chocolate‐free run‐in phase, 20 never‐treated, grade I patients with EH (10 males; 43.7+/‐7.8 years) were randomized to receive either 100 g per day DC (containing 88 mg flavanols) or 90 g per day flavanol‐free white chocolate (WC) in an isocaloric manner for 15 days. After a second 7‐day chocolate‐free period, patients were crossed over to the other treatment. Noninvasive 24‐hour ambulatory BP, FMD, OGTT, serum cholesterol, and markers of vascular inflammation were evaluated at the end of each treatment. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were calculated from OGTT values. Ambulatory BP decreased after DC (24‐hour systolic BP ‐11.9+/‐7.7 mm Hg, P<0.0001; 24‐hour diastolic BP ‐8.5+/‐5.0 mm Hg, P<0.0001) but not WC. DC but not WC decreased HOMA‐IR (P<0.0001), but it improved QUICKI, ISI, and FMD. DC also decreased serum LDL cholesterol (from 3.4+/‐0.5 to 3.0+/‐0.6 mmol/L; P<0.05). In summary, DC decreased BP and serum LDL cholesterol, improved FMD, and ameliorated insulin sensitivity in hypertensives. These results suggest that, while balancing total calorie intake, flavanols from cocoa products may provide some cardiovascular benefit if included as part of a healthy diet for patients with EH.

AB  -  Introduction Hypertension is the commonest medical complication of pregnancy. It is associated with high maternal and perinatal mortality, especially when severe. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy constitute one of the five major causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in obstetric practice, accounting for approximately 63,000 maternal deaths worldwide annually. It has been noted to complicate about 6‐12% of pregnancies; with preeclampsia accounting for about half of these cases, while the relatively benign chronic hypertension and gestational hypertension constitute the rest. Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure equal to or above 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure equal to or above 90 mmHg, measured on two or more occasions, at least four to six hours apart. It is said to be severe when the systolic blood pressure is equal to or greater than 160 mmHg and/or the diastolic blood pressure is equal to or greater than 110 mmHg. Hypertension in pregnancy is most worrisome when it is severe because of the associated maternal end organ damage, with associated maternal morbidity and mortality, as well as fetal complications. The end organ damage associated with severe hypertension includes renal impairment, heart failure, liver damage, pulmonary edema and cerebral injury. Though any of these complications may eventually lead to patient's demise, the most common cause of death in patients with severe hypertension is cerebro‐vascular accident, resulting from disruption of cerebral auto‐regulatory mechanism and increased perfusion pressure. There is also increased vascular permeability, leading to hemo‐concentration, which predisposes the patient to cerebral thrombosis as well as the vasospasm associated with convulsion. Other complications include placenta abruption, preterm delivery and increased risk of cesarean delivery. In order to reduce the maternal complications associated with severe hypertension in pregnancy, there is the need for immediate treatment to lower the severely elevated blood pressure. However, due to the fact that the placenta functions as a low resistance shunt without auto‐regulation, lowering the blood pressure too fast or too far may lead to reduced utero‐placental perfusion, which is detrimental to the fetus. Therefore the reduction in blood pressure, though prompt, should be controlled, with a target of 140‐150 mmHg systolic and 90‐100 mmHg diastolic. The primary purpose of this treatment is not to change the course of the disease but to prevent cerebral hemorrhage and hypertensive encephalopathy associated with such severely elevated blood pressure. Thus the initial focus of the treatment is directed towards the safety of the mother, which is necessary to ensure that of the fetus. The most commonly used anti‐hypertensive drugs for the control of severe hypertension in pregnancy are nifedipine, labetalol and hydralazine. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker which blocks the L‐type calcium channels in both the cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby exerting negative inotropic effects on the heart and causing vascular dilatation which results in decreased systemic vascular resistance. It is available in tablet and capsule forms. Labetalol is a non‐selective α1, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors antagonist. It acts by dilating arterioles, thereby decreasing vascular resistance without significantly lowering the cardiac output. It may be administered orally (tablet) or intravenously. Hydralazine also lowers blood pressure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance through direct dilatation of arterioles. It is administered both intravenously and orally. These drugs have been compared with each other in different randomized controlled trials. While it is generally accepted that the three drugs are effective in controlling severe hypertension, different trials have recommended labetalol, hydralazine or nifedipine as the first line agent; and the others (as the case may be), as alternatives, depending on the prevailing circumstances and considerations of the trials. As a result of the differences in the outcomes of randomized controlled trials on efficacy and safety of anti‐hypertensive use in pregnancy, there is no consensus on which agent is the safest and most effective. A recent Cochrane review on 'drugs for treatment of very high blood pressure during pregnancy' concluded that, until better evidence was available, the choice of anti‐hypertensive drugs should depend on the clinician's experience with the particular drug, on what was known about the side effects, as well as the women's preferences. Other factors that determine anti‐hypertensive choice are availability, cost, fetal and maternal condition at admission. This leaves the choice of drugs to the physician's discretion which is very subjective. In Nigeria, there has been no clinical data specifying the preferred anti‐hypertensive agent (among the three earlier stated) in the management of severe hypertension in pregnancy. Drug use in such circumstances has generally been based on studies done in America and Europe. Intravenous hydralazine is the most commonly used anti‐hypertensive drug in severe hypertension because of its long term established safety, efficacy, availability and cost‐effectiveness. However, its administration requires more resources in terms of equipment (i.e. syringes and needles as well as intravenous cannula) and personnel (administered usually by doctors or occasionally, nurses) than that of oral agents. Its common side effects, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting may mimic symptoms of deteriorating preeclampsia and thereby create confusion during management. Also, maternal hypotension is common with parenteral hydralazine, which has been shown to be associated with an excess of caesarean sections, placental abruptions, and low Apgar scores (< 7) at five minutes compared to labetalol and nifedipine. In view of these limitations of hydralazine, there is a need to find alternative drugs with equal efficacy in controlling severe hypertension but with fewer side effects. Nifedipine is cheap, easy to administer, widely available and has less tendency to cause maternal hypotension resulting in fetal compromise. As a result of these qualities and the peculiarity of our society in terms of availability of skilled man‐power, it is necessary to know if it is comparable with hydralazine in terms of efficacy and safety, with the hope of recommending its use in treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy in Nigeria. Justification The use of parenteral agents, such as hydralazine for severe hypertension in pregnancy requires more resources, monitoring and supervision because they are fast‐acting; and as a result they have the potential to lower BP within minutes and cause maternal hypotension and fetal compromise. Due to the limited manpower and resources in Nigeria, any agent that is cheap, effective, easy to administer without much expertise and causes the fewest side effects will be beneficial to patients in such setting. Nifedipine is an effective rapidly acting anti‐hypertensive. It does not crash BP but controls it gradually over a period of time. Its simplicity stems from the fact that it comes in tablet and capsule forms, which can be easily administered without elaborate training. These qualities make it easy to administer in many rural settings which are prevalent in developing countries such as Nigeria. The need for this study stems from the fact that further studies have been recommended by the studies done on this subject which are mainly in Europe and America. Its use for control of severe hypertension may be important in Nigeria setting, if found effective as hydralazine, due to the aforementioned challenges. Research questions 1. Is nifedipine as effective as hydralazine in controlling severe hypertension in pregnancy? 2. Is nifedipine comparable to hydralazine in sustaining blood pressure control? 3. Is nifedipine comparable to hydralazine in fetal and maternal side effects? Aim of the study The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of oral nifedipine with intravenous (I.V.) hydralazine in controlling severe hypertension in pregnancy. Objectives of the study The objectives of this study are as follows: 1. To determine the efficacy of oral nifedipine in the management of severe hypertension in pregnancy in terms of reduction in BP below 160 mmHg systolic and 110 mmHg diastolic 2. To determine the efficacy of I.V. hydralazine in the management of severe hypertension in pregnancy in terms of reduction in BP below 160 mmHg systolic and 110 mmHg diastolic 3. To compare the efficacy of oral nifedipine with that of intravenous hydralazine in terms of reduction of blood pressure below 160 mmHg systolic and 110 mmHg diastolic and maintaining blood pressure control 4. To compare the risk of maternal hypotension using nifedipine compared with hydralazine 5. To compare neonatal side effects following administration of nifedipine to that of hydralazine using APGAR scores at 1st and 5th minutes after delivery Materials and method Study design This will be an open label randomized controlled trial of nifedipine versus hydralazine in control of severe hypertension in pregnancy at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State. Nifedipine 20 mg tablet will be used and compared with 10 mg intravenous hydralazine. Equivalence study design will be used. Study background Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki (AEFUTHA), where this study will be carried out, is the only tertiary hospital in Ebonyi state, Nigeria. It is located at the center of Abakaliki, the capital city of Ebonyi state. The state, located in the South‐Eastern part of Nigeria, was created on October 1, 1996 and has 13 local government areas; with Abakaliki, the state capital as the only urban settlement in the state. The state has a population of about 2.1 million people, based on the 2006 national population census. The department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, AEFUTHA, is one of the clinical departments in the hospital. It serves as a major referral center for other hospitals in Ebonyi and the neighboring states of Enugu, Benue and Cross River. There are 52 obstetric bed spaces including antenatal and postnatal wards. The department has five teams which are sub‐divided into two units each. Each unit is manned by at least two consultants. Resident doctors are distributed to cover all the units. The department runs antenatal clinics managed by the consultants and resident doctors, assisted by midwives and other health workers. Antenatal clients are booked daily on every week day and are assigned consultants according to the units/teams running antenatal clinic each day. The average antenatal booking is about 4,200 clients per year, while the total antenatal clinic attendance averages 21,000 per year, with an average annual delivery rate of 2,900. The department has established protocols for management of specific cases which are in accordance with international best practices, and are displayed in the labor ward, antenatal ward and the accident and emergency unit of the hospital. These protocols serve as guides, as patient management is still individualized. Pregnant women with severe hypertension in pregnancy are usually admitted into any of the aforementioned wards, depending on the clinical condition at presentation. For patients with severe preeclampsia, the departmental protocol is to stabilize the patient and deliver through the most expeditious route following stabilization, while those with chronic hypertension and gestational hypertension may be allowed for prolongation of gestation so far the blood pressure is under control; and other clinical and laboratory parameters are satisfactory. Blood pressure control in severe hypertension is one of the cardinal points in stabilization; and this is usually done with intravenous hydralazine, or occasionally with intravenous labetalol. Hydralazine is usually given intravenously as 5‐10 mg, diluted in 10 ml of normal saline and given over 10 minutes. Blood pressure is checked every 5 minutes, with target blood pressure of 140‐150 mmHg systolic and 90‐100 mmHg diastolic. Excessive lowering of BP is avoided to prevent fetal compromise. Following this, blood pressure control is usually maintained with oral medications which include nifedipine and α‐methyl dopa, used singly or in combination, in majority of cases. Labetalol tablets may be added in cases where blood pressure control becomes difficult. Patients are usually managed in conjunction with the cardiologists, who may modify the drugs as the need arises. From the preliminary report of unpublished yearly departmental audit, 175 pregnant women were admitted and managed for severe hypertension in pregnancy in 2016 out of 2,910 deliveries. Study population Participants to be included in this study will be patients with severe hypertension in pregnancy admitted and managed at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki who meet the inclusion criteria and consent to participate in the study. Sample size determination The minimum sample size will be determined using statistical formula for equivalence study design N = 2 x {Z1‐α/2 + Z1‐β}2 x P x (1‐P) { δo } N = number of patients per group Z = the standard normal deviate for a one or two sided study, usually set at 1.96. δo = clinically acceptable difference in attainment of target blood pressure will be set at 30% P = treatment response of nifedipine relative to hydralazine in a systematic review = 84% α = type I error = ≤5% β = type II error =≤ 10% (90% power) N = 2 {1.96 + 1.28}2 x 0.84 x (1‐0.84) { 0.3 } N = 2 (3.24)2 x 0.84 x 0.16 ( 0.3) N = 2 x 10.82 x 0.1344 N = 2 x 116.64 x 0.1344 N = 31.35 ≈ 31 patients per group This will represent the number of patients per group. Twenty percent of this minimum sample size will be added to correct for any attrition that may occur in the course of the study. The final sample size on each arm of the study will now be 37 while the total will be 74. Patients' selection, drug administration and study procedure Patients' Selection Patients to be included in the study are those who present with severe hypertension in pregnancy; meet the inclusion criteria and consent to participate in the study. Detailed history will be obtained and thorough examination will be carried out on all patients. Relevant investigations, which include blood group and Rhesus type, complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, coagulation profile and urine analysis for proteinuria, will be carried out. The participants will be randomized by means of computer generated random numbers, by a statistician, using the software Research Randomizer®. Using this software, thirty‐four numbers will be randomly generated from a pool of sixty‐eight numbers (1‐74) and these numbers will be assigned to group A (nifedipine) while the remaining thirty‐four numbers will automatically be assigned to group B (hydralazine). These numbers (1‐74) will be inscribed on brown envelopes and a piece of paper with the inscription 'nifedipine' or 'hydralazine' will be put, with the respective drug accordingly, inside these envelopes and sealed. All the envelopes will be kept in a locker that will be made accessible to all the members of the research team. During the counselling session, patients will be made to know what the drug is meant to do for them and the possible side effects. Participants, who meet the inclusion criteria, having understood the study and signed the informed consent form, will be given sequential study numbers and the corresponding numbered opaque sealed envelope will then be allocated to the patient. The particular drug contained in this numbered envelope, corresponding to the patient's study number, will be given to the patient. Drug Administration Patients on nifedipine arm (group A) of the study will receive oral nifedipine 20 mg statim, then 20 mg after 30 minutes if blood pressure still remains equal to or above 160/110 mmHg. The 20 mg dose will be repeated every 30 minutes until desired BP (140‐150 mmHg/90‐100 mmHg) is reached or five doses have been given. The drug will be given to the patient to swallow in the presence of a nurse. If a patient vomits within 10 minutes of administration of the drug, the dose will be repeated. In cases where nifedipine fails to control the B.P., other anti‐hypertensive drugs (such as hydralazine or labetalol) will be administered as may be required. Those on hydralazine arm (group B) of the study will receive 10 mg of intravenous hydralazine, diluted 10 ml of water for injection and given over 10 minutes. If B.P. remains equal to or above 160/110 mmHg 30 minutes after administration of the drug, intravenous hydralazine 10 mg, diluted with 10 ml of water for injection, will be administered over 10 minutes. This will be repeated every 30 minutes until the desired B.P. (140‐150 mmHg/90‐100 mmHg) is reached or five doses have been given. In cases where blood pressure remains uncontrolled, other anti‐hypertensive drugs (such as labetalol or nifedipine) will be administered as may be required. Blood pressure will be checked every 5 minutes during the period of administration of these drugs. Intravenous Ringer's lactate or normal saline will be provided at the bedside of the patients, which will be rapidly infused in case hypotension develops. Monitoring of Patients Patients will be monitored by measuring the blood pressure with mercury sphygmomanometers. These sphygmomanometers will be regularly calibrated to ensure accuracy of blood pressure measurement. Blood pressure will be taken with the patients sitting down to prevent the effect of the pregnant uterus on blood pressure and ensure uniformity. Larger cuff will be provided for obese patients to minimize errors. The rate of deflation of the cuff will be at 2‐3 mmHg per second and the sphygmomanometer will be placed at the level of the heart. The systolic blood pressure will be read at the point where the first Korotkoff sound is heard with the eyes placed at the same level as the point of systolic blood pressure; while the diastolic blood pressure will be the point of disappearance of the Korotkoff sound or where it becomes muffled in cases where the sound continues till or near the zero mark. The examiner's eyes will be placed at this level to read the diastolic blood pressure. This is to avoid error due to parallax. Rounding off figures will be discouraged. Statistical analysis Data will be collated, tabulated and then statistically analysed using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) (IBM) software (version 22, Chicago USA). Continuous variables will be presented as mean and standard deviation (mean ±2SD), while categorical variables will be presented as numbers and percentages. Chi‐square test (X2) will be used for comparison between groups of qualitative variables while normal z‐test, odds ratio and confidence interval at 95% will be used for comparison between groups of quantitative variables. A difference with a p‐value <0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Ethical considerations Ethical clearance has been obtained from the Health Research and Ethics committee of the Hospital. In designing this study, the following ethical issues were put into consideration. Informed consent: A signed‐written consent will be obtained from each participant before recruitment into the study. The study objectives, procedure and full implications of participation will be discussed with the participants before their consent is obtained. The participants will be made to understand that declining participation in the study will have no consequences in her obtaining adequate care. Confidentiality of data: All information, including history, physical examination findings and results obtained from the participants shall be kept strictly confidential. The participants will be assured that their identity will be kept in confidence by the investigator. Dissemination of results from study The results from this proposed study will be submitted to the Human Research and Ethics Committee (HREC) ‐ AEFUTHA. A dissertation will be made from the findings of this study and submitted to the West African College of Surgeons, Faculty of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Finally it will be published in a reputable international medical journal.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Blood pressure variability and central SBP are independent markers of cardiovascular risk. Data on lifestyle‐interventions to reduce these parameters are sparse. The present work reports the differential effects of aerobic vs. isometric handgrip exercise on blood pressure variability and central SBP in a prospective randomized trial. METHODS: Seventy‐five hypertensive patients were randomized to one of the following 12‐week programs: isometric handgrip training five times weekly; 'Sham‐handgrip training' five times weekly; aerobic exercise training (30 min three to five times/week). Blood pressure variability was assessed by the coefficient of variation in 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Central SBP was measured noninvasively by the SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical, Australia). RESULTS: The aerobic exercise program significantly decreased systolic daytime variability (12.1 ± 2.5 vs. 10.3 ± 2.8, P = 0.04), whereas diastolic daytime blood pressure variability was not significantly altered (P = 0.14). Night‐time variability was not significantly affected (P > 0.05). Central SBP was reduced from 145±15 to 134 ± 19 mmHg (P = 0.01). Isometric handgrip and sham‐handgrip exercise did not significantly affect blood pressure variability (P > 0.05 each). Isometric exercise tended to reduce central SBP (142 ± 19 to 136 ± 17 mmHg, P = 0.06). ANCOVA revealed significant intergroup differences for the change of daytime SBP and DBP variability (P = 0.048 and 0.047, respectively). CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise reduces blood pressure variability and central SBP. Isometric handgrip exercise does not reduce blood pressure variability but tends to lower central SBP in this hypertensive population.

AB  -  Whole‐day ambulatory monitoring is used for diagnosing hypertension and for judging response to treatment. We evaluated both of these properties in an antihypertensive trial with the calcium channel blocker diltiazem hydrochloride. Measured by a conventional sphygmomanometer, systolic and diastolic blood pressures fell significantly in patients who received diltiazem, whereas no consistent changes occurred in those who received placebo. Administration of the drug also decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressures evenly throughout the day, as determined by automated monitoring. The 15 diltiazem‐treated patients were subdivided into those whose clinically diagnosed hypertension was confirmed by pretreatment blood pressure monitoring (24‐hour average diastolic blood pressure, greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg; n = 9) and those whose 24‐hour blood pressures failed to meet this criterion (n = 6). Diltiazem therapy decreased average whole‐day blood pressures by 18/13 mm Hg in the hypertensives but by only 0/1 mm Hg in the others. Thus, whole‐day blood pressure monitoring strengthens antihypertensive trials by documenting efficacy and duration of treatment. In addition, it enhances the diagnosis of hypertension, thereby identifying those patients in whom treatment seems justified.

AB  -  The aim of this prospective, randomized, open‐label, masked, end‐point, crossover study was to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of valsartan with that of losartan‐angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists with different pharmacologic profiles‐in patients with mild‐to‐moderate essential hypertension. After an initial 2‐week placebo washout period, 40 patients (24 men and 16 women, aged 39 to 58 years) were assigned randomly to receive valsartan 80 mg or losartan 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks. After an intermediate 2‐week placebo washout period, patients were switched to the alternative regimen for an additional 4 weeks. After the initial placebo washout period and every 2 weeks thereafter, 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed using a noninvasive device, and casual blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured. Both losartan and valsartan had a clear‐cut antihypertensive effect. However, valsartan showed significantly better antihypertensive efficacy compared with that of losartan, as demonstrated by (1) the 24‐hour, daytime, and nighttime ABPM values, which were significantly lower (P < 0.01) with valsartan; (2) the percentage of abnormal BP readings, which was significantly lower with valsartan; (3) the trough/peak ratio and the smoothness index, which were both significantly greater with valsartan, suggesting a more homogeneous antihypertensive effect; and (4) the 24‐hour postdosing clinic systolic and diastolic values, which were lower than those obtained with losartan. These findings underline the potential importance of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences in terms of antihypertensive efficacy for the different drugs belonging to the Ang II receptor antagonist class.

AB  -  Home blood pressure monitoring is useful in detecting white‐coat and masked hypertension and is recommended for patients with suspected or treated hypertension. The prognostic significance of white‐coat and masked hypertension detected by home measurement was investigated in 6458 participants from 5 populations enrolled in the International Database of HOme blood pressure in relation to Cardiovascular Outcomes. During a median follow‐up of 8.3 years, 714 fatal plus nonfatal cardiovascular events occurred. Among untreated subjects (n=5007), cardiovascular risk was higher in those with white‐coat hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio 1.42; 95% CI [1.06‐1.91]; P=0.02), masked hypertension (1.55; 95% CI [1.12‐2.14]; P<0.01) and sustained hypertension (2.13; 95% CI [1.66‐2.73]; P<0.0001) compared with normotensive subjects. Among treated patients (n=1451), the cardiovascular risk did not differ between those with high office and low home blood pressure (white‐coat) and treated controlled subjects (low office and home blood pressure; 1.16; 95% CI [0.79‐1.72]; P=0.45). However, treated subjects with masked hypertension (low office and high home blood pressure; 1.76; 95% CI [1.23‐2.53]; P=0.002) and uncontrolled hypertension (high office and home blood pressure; 1.40; 95% CI [1.02‐1.94]; P=0.04) had higher cardiovascular risk than treated controlled patients. In conclusion, white‐coat hypertension assessed by home measurements is a cardiovascular risk factor in untreated but not in treated subjects probably because the latter receive effective treatment on the basis of their elevated office blood pressure. In contrast, masked uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in both untreated and treated patients, who are probably undertreated because of their low office blood pressure. 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  -  Objective: Hypertension has one of the highest morbidity and mortality in Chinese society, there were 270 million hypertension patients by the year of 2017, which brings a lot of pressure on the social health work. A whole new approach based on home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) using advanced data processing measures may be a feasible way to help early diagnosing and controlling hypertension. Design and method: We are here to put forward a prospective, randomized controlled trail to assess the effects of a Smart Operated Hbpm Outlook (SOHO), which consists of an individual‐automated electronic sphygmomanometer that real‐time (3 times a day) uploads BP to a specific cloud database, processed data will be programmed to send alert to physicians or community pharmacists if there is a rapid change on patients' BP level or if there is a need of medical titration. We plan to enroll 100 participants with complete three‐month follow‐up data. The enrolled adults will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to the SOHO program or to HBPM alone. The primary study outcome will be systolic blood pressure at 3 months. Additional outcomes include measures of weight and renal function(eGFR), record of self‐management compliance and titration of antihypertensive medications. Results: The SOHO program will evaluate blood pressure and hypertension selfmanagement outcomes in participants with hypertension with the intervention of physician and community pharmacists compared to those practice home blood pressure monitoring alone. Conclusions: The whole new HBPM‐based SOHO study may be a feasible way to better control blood pressure of elderly in Chinese community. This approach may reduce the expenses of health care in Chinese society, especially mega‐cities like Shanghai.

AB  -  HYPOTHESIS: Hypertensive striatin risk allele carriers will show significantly greater reductions in blood pressure with a specific aldosterone mediated treatment approach (mineralocorticoid receptor blockade) than with a non‐specific approach (amlodipine). RATIONALE: Striatin deficient versus wild‐type mice have salt sensitive blood pressure and inappropriately increased aldosterone levels on a liberal salt diet. In observational studies, the investigators documented that in humans, striatin risk allele carriers also have salt sensitive blood pressure. Since aldosterone increases sodium retention, excess aldosterone levels could be one mechanism for their salt sensitive blood pressure. The goal of this project is to document that a genetic marker identifies individuals who are uniquely responsive to mineralocorticoid receptor blockade ‐ personalized, precision medicine. The investigators will perform a novel two‐limb, proof‐of‐principle, randomized, double‐blind, active controlled study contrasting a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist versus a calcium channel blocker in hypertensive striatin risk allele carriers. Our primary outcome will be systolic blood pressure assessed on a liberal salt diet with our secondary outcome being salt sensitive blood pressure. PRELIMINARY RESULTS: The investigators recently reported that in two large cohorts from HyperPATH, the striatin risk allele carriers have increased blood pressure on a liberal salt diet and salt sensitive blood pressure. The link between striatin risk allele and salt sensitive blood pressure was seen in ALL participant groups ‐ hypertensives, Caucasians, Africans, males, females, old and young. The investigators then created a striatin deficient mouse. It also had salt sensitive blood pressure. Furthermore, compared to wild‐type mice, the striatin deficient mice had increased aldosterone levels on a liberal salt diet. An inappropriate aldosterone level for the level of sodium intake is a well‐known and important mediator of salt sensitive blood pressure and hypertension. Thus, if human striatin risk allele carriers have dysregulated aldosterone production, this genetic biomarker could identify subjects at increased risk for aldosterone‐mediated salt sensitive blood pressure and hypertension. SUBJECT POPULATION: It is estimated that most of the striatin rs2540923 risk allele carriers will come from our HyperPATH cohort. Because there are no racial, age or ethnic differences in the salt sensitive blood pressure responses observed, an equal number of females and males and the same proportion of Africans as in the HyperPATH cohort will be studied. Additional subjects will be recruited from the West Roxbury VA Health Care System and/or BWH and Partners Healthcare's Research Patient Data Registry. As an example of the richness of these sources, Research Patient Data Registry contains over 90,000 hypertensive patients, ages 17‐65 years with 13.5 % of African descent and 52.8 % women. The investigators will recruit approximately 105 individuals to have 45 individuals in each drug group for analyses. This assumes that the investigators will have 10‐15% non‐completers. Based on our previous studies the investigators estimated that approximately 10% of hypertensives will be carriers of the rs2540923 risk allele. The investigators have DNA, history, screening laboratory tests, and physical examinations on 4000 individuals in HyperPATH. Approximately 60% have hypertension and 10% carry the risk allele, i.e., approximately 250 individuals. The investigators estimate from our previous use of this cohort that the investigators will be able to recruit 75‐80 individuals during the 4 years of this project. Thus, the investigators will need to recruit 25‐30 new subjects over four years, i.e., 6‐8 per year. The research Patient Data Registry is the source from which the investigators have the most success. Approximately 20% of those to whom the investigators send requests to participate in the study enter the electronic screening phase. Approximately 50% of these subjects enter the clinic screening phase and about 25% of them are enrolled in a study that is comparable or more time consuming than the one proposed in this project. Thus, the investigators will need to invite each month approximately 200 of the 90,000 hypertensives in the Research Patient Data Registry to participate in our study. All subjects will be genotyped at rs2540923, and the risk allele carriers will be entered into the protocol and randomized blindly into one or the other treatment arms. PROTOCOL: 1. The screened, eligible hypertensives will enter a two‐week single blind placebo washout phase. Pill count will be used to determine compliance. Those with blood pressure between 145‐170/90‐109 mmHg and pill count between 80‐100% will enter the randomized phase and counseled regarding salt intake. 2. The first step: subjects will be counseled regarding liberal salt dietary intake to ensure similar intakes in all subjects [Na+ (200 mEq), potassium (K+, 100 mEq) and calcium (800 mg)]. This or a greater level of Na+ intake was consumed by 60‐70% of subjects before entering the HyperPATH protocol. After completion of this diet for 7 days, the subject will come to the Center for Clinical Investigation (CCI) Ambulatory Clinical Center between 7‐8 AM, fasting, and after remaining supine for 60‐90 mins will have blood samples obtained for future analyses, and their BP measured using an automatic recording sphygmomanometer (Space Labs, Snoqualmie, WA). Readings will be obtained every 2 mins for 20 mins with the highest and lowest values discarded and the rest averaged. From the morning of the 6th to the morning of the 7th day, a 24‐hr. urine will be collected for creatinine and Na+ as a check on balance and stored for future analyses. 3. The second step: subjects will then be fed a 10 mEq Na+, 100 mEq K+ calculated diet for 7 days. The meals will be provided by the CCI Dietary Core. On the morning of the 7th day, the subjects will come fasting to the CCI Ambulatory Clinical Center between 7‐8 AM. After remaining supine for 60‐90 minutes, the subjects will have blood samples obtained for future analyses and their blood pressure measured using an automatic recording sphygmomanometer (Space Labs, Snoqualmie, WA). Readings will be obtained every 2 minutes for 20 minutes with the highest and lowest values discarded and the rest averaged. From the morning of the 6th to the morning of the 7th day a 24‐hr. urine will be collected for creatinine and sodium as a check on balance and stored for future analyses. Creatinine and Na+ in urine from both days will be measured in the BWH clinical laboratory. The BP data from 2) and 3) will allow us to calculate SSBP, an approach performed successfully more than 500 times in the HyperPATH cohort. 4. The hypertensive striatin risk carrier subjects will be randomized, double blinded to one of two primary treatment groups and titrated to effect every four weeks, as was previously reported (1, 2), eplerenone 50, 100 and 200 mg daily or amlodipine 2.5, 5 and 10 mg daily. Study duration will be sixteen weeks. 5. Participants will be randomized in blocks of two to 1 of 2 study drugs (amlodipine and eplerenone). The drug class assignment will remain the same throughout the study for each subject. The PI or Co‐PI will notify The Brigham and Womens Hospital Investigational Drug Pharmacy Service to escalate or maintain current dose on each of the three visits. The Brigham and Womens Hospital Investigational Drug Pharmacy Service will be responsible for the randomization schema, recording of study drug assignment, and dispensing of prescriptions. All others (PI, Co‐PI, research staff, subject) will be blinded as to drug assignment. 6. Home seated, morning cuff blood pressure and pulse will be obtained daily and monitored by study staff weekly as a safety check with the information provided to the study staff by email or phone. A member of the research team will contact the subject if the blood pressure data are not received within 24‐hr of the designated time. If the cuff blood pressure is greater than 170/109 mmHg on two consecutive occasions 24 hours apart, or the subject develops cardiovascular symptoms, the subject will be terminated from the study and re‐started on medications used before the washout period. The subject's physician will be contacted. 7. Serum K+ will be obtained 1 week after each titration in dose. If serum K+ is greater than 5.5 mM on two consecutive occasions 24 hours apart, the subject will be terminated from the study. If unexpected adverse event is noted The Brigham and Women's Hospital Investigational Drug Pharmacy Service will be notified so as to break code and identify agent. 8. At the end of four weeks since randomization and the subjects have completed the first dose of the agent, the subject will be counseled regarding a 24‐hour dietary intake of sodium (200 mEq), potassium (100 mEq) and calcium (800 mg). After completion of this diet for 5 days, the subject returns to Center for Clinical Investigation ‐ Ambulatory Clinical Center between 7‐8 AM, fasting, and after remaining supine for 60‐90 minutes again will have blood samples obtained for future analyses and their blood pressure measured using an automatic recording sphygmomanometer. Readings will be obtained every 2 minutes for 20 minutes with the highest and lowest values discarded and the rest averaged. This measurement will be used to assess the blood pressure response to a single dose of each agent and to determine if the subject has reached goal blood pressure (less than or equal to140/90 mmHg). If not, the subject's dose is up titrated as per protocol; otherwise the subject is maintained on his/her current dose. 9. Home seated, morning cuff blood pressure and pulse will be obtained daily and monitored by study staff weekly as a safety check with the information provided to the study staff by email or phone. A member of the research team will contact the subject if the blood pressure data are not received within 24‐hr of the designated time. If the cuff blood pressure is greater than 170/109 mmHg on two consecutive occasions 24 hours apart, or the subject develops cardiovascular symptoms, the subject will be terminated from the study and re‐started on medications used before the washout period. The subject's physician will be contacted. 10. Serum K+ will be obtained 1 week after each titration in dose. If serum K+ is greater than 5.5 mM on two consecutive occasions 24 hours apart, the subject will be terminated from the study. If unexpected adverse event is noted The Brigham and Women's Hospital Investigational Drug Pharmacy Service will be notified so as to break code and identify agent. 11. At the end of eight weeks since randomization and the subjects have completed the second dose of the agent, the subject will be counseled regarding a 24‐hour dietary intake of sodium (200 mEq), potassium (100 mEq) and calcium (800 mg). After completion of this diet for 5 days, the subject returns to Center for Clinical Investigation ‐ Ambulatory Clinical Center between 7‐8 AM, fasting, and after remaining supine for 60‐90 minutes again will have blood samples obtained for future analyses and their blood pressure measured using an automatic recording sphygmomanometer.

Home seated, morning cuff blood pressure and pulse will be obtained daily and monitored by study staff weekly as a safety check with the information provided to the study staff by email or phone. A member of the research team will contact the subject if the blood pressure data are not received within 24‐hr of the designated time. If the cuff blood pressure is greater than 170/109 mmHg on two consecutive occasions 24 hours apart, or the subject develops cardiovascular symptoms, the subject will be terminated from the study and re‐started on medications used before the washout period. The subject's physician will be contacted. 13. Serum K+ will be obtained 1 week later. If serum K+ is greater than 5.5 mM on two consecutive occasions 24 hours apart the subject will be terminated from the study. If unexpected adverse event is noted The Brigham and Women's Hospital Investigational Drug Pharmacy Service will be notified so as to break code and identify agent. 14. At the end of twelve weeks since randomization and the subjects have completed the second dose of each agent, the subject will be counseled regarding a 24‐hour dietary intake of sodium (200 mEq), potassium (100 mEq) and calcium (800 mg). After completion of this diet for 5 days, the subject returns to Center for Clinical Investigation ‐ Ambulatory Clinical Center between 7‐8 AM, fasting, and after remaining supine for 60‐90 minutes again will have blood samples obtained for future analyses and their blood pressure measured using an automatic recording sphygmomanometer. Readings will be obtained every 2 minutes for 20 minutes with the highest and lowest values discarded and the rest averaged. This measurement will be used to assess the blood pressure response to a single dose of each agent and to determine if the subject has reached goal blood pressure (less than or equal to140/90 mmHg). If not, the subject's dose is up titrated as per protocol; otherwise the subject is maintained on his/her current dose. 15. Home seated, morning cuff blood pressure and pulse will be obtained daily and monitored by study staff weekly as a safety check with the information provided to the study staff by email or phone. A member of the research team will contact the subject if the blood pressure data are not received within 24‐hr of the designated time. If the cuff blood pressure is greater than 170/109 mmHg on two consecutive occasions 24 hours apart, or the subject develops cardiovascular symptoms, the subject will be terminated from the study and re‐started on medications used before the washout period. The subject's physician will be contacted. 16. Serum K+ will be obtained 1 week. If serum K+ is greater than 5.5 mM on two consecutive occasions 24 hours apart the subject will be terminated from the study. If unexpected adverse event is noted The Brigham and Women's Hospital Investigational Drug Pharmacy Service will be notified so as to break code and identify agent. 17. At the end of the study, sixteen weeks after randomization, the subjects will repeat the liberal salt / low salt study performed at randomization. Subjects will be counseled regarding liberal salt dietary intake to ensure similar intakes in all subjects [Na+ (200 mEq), potassium (K+, 100 mEq) and calcium (800 mg)]. This or a greater level of Na+ intake was consumed by 60‐70% of subjects before entering the HyperPATH protocol. After completion of this diet for 7 days, the subject will come to the Center for Clinical Investigation (CCI) Ambulatory Clinical Center between 7‐8 AM, fasting, and after remaining supine for 60‐90 mins will have blood samples obtained for future analyses, and their BP measured using an automatic recording sphygmomanometer (Space Labs, Snoqualmie, WA). Readings will be obtained every 2 mins for 20 mins with the highest and lowest values discarded and the rest averaged. From the morning of the 6th to the morning of the 7th day, a 24‐hr. urine will be collected for creatinine and Na+ as a check on balance and stored for future analyses. 18. Subjects will then be fed a 10 mEq sodium, 100 mEq potassium calculated diet for 7 days. The meals will be provided by the Center for Clinical Investigation ‐ Dietary Core. On the morning of the 7th day, the subjects will come fasting to the Center for Clinical Investigation ‐ Ambulatory Clinical Center between 7‐8 AM. After remaining supine for 60‐90 minutes, the subjects will have blood samples obtained for future analyses and their blood pressure measured using an automatic recording sphygmomanometer. Readings will be obtained every 2 minutes for 20 minutes with the highest and lowest values discarded and the rest averaged. From the morning of the 6th to the morning of the 7th day a 24‐hr. urine will be collected for creatinine and sodium as a check on balance and stored for future analyses. The blood pressure data from 2) and 3) will allow us to calculate salt sensitive blood pressure. This approach has been performed successfully more than 500 times in some subjects in the HyperPATH cohort. 19. The subject then will have completed the study and will be re‐started on medications used before the washout period. The subject's physician will be contacted. ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Based on our Preliminary Results, the investigators anticipate that: 1) in response to the first dose of each agent, the risk allele carriers will have significantly greater BP reductions with eplerenone than with amlodipine; 2) a significantly lower dose of eplerenone will be required to achieve goal BP than with amlodipine; and 3) greater reduction in SSBP will occur with eplerenone than with amlodipine. If proven, these results will support: a) proof of principle that an activated MR, likely secondary to increased ALDO, is contributing to the HTN in STRN risk allele carriers, a conclusion inferred from HET‐KO studies described in our Preliminary Results; b) that genotype can be used to predict therapeutic response in HTN ‐a positive application of pharmacogenetics to a complex, common condition; and c) provide specific information necessary to appropriately statically power and design a definitive clinical trial. The investigators also will draw on data obtained from the studies performed in AIMS 2 and 3 in designing this new trial. The investigators anticipate that this new treatment trial will contrast not only BP and SSBP responses to specific treatments in carriers versus non‐carriers (a control group) of the STRN risk allele, but also will assess the human relevance of the likely mechanisms linking STRN to SSBP, as will be suggested by the data generated in the mechanistic studies (AIMS 2 and 3 of this project). For example, if AIM 3 shows that STRN deficiency results in decreased RBF response to a liberal salt intake, then in addition to measuring the response of BP and SSBP to specific therapy, the investigators will measure the treatment's effect on RBF. ALTERNATIVE RESULTS AND POTENTIAL PITFALLS: First, a negative outcome may not be a true treatment failure, but secondary to: 1) the length of treatment being too short; 2) an ALDO mediated effect not blocked by eplerenone; or 3) an ALDO mediated effect whose mechanism is made worse by blocking the MR. These possibilities, in part will be addressed in AIM 2 where the investigators are determining the mechanism(s) underlying the STRN/ALDO interaction. Second, a positive outcome could indicate that an activated MR is a proximate mediator of the increased liberal salt BP and SSBP associated with STRN's risk allele carriers. However, since the investigators did not include a control group (non‐risk allele carriers), a future study would need to be performed as outlined in the Anticipated Results above. Third, the STRN risk allele carriers do have increased liberal salt BP and SSBP but the primary mechanism is dysfunction in the renal vasculature. This possibility will be addressed in AIM 3. Fourth, the study's length could lead to a false positive, i.e. the length is not long enough to see an initial difference disappearing with longer therapeutic exposure. However, the investigators believe the trial length is appropriate because: 1) most clinical trials using these agents achieve stable BP responses during this time interval; 2) with eplerenone treatment, BP nadirs after three months with no significant changes even if therapy is extended to a year. Finally, the study is too complicated. The investigators will have too many dropouts. The investigators have completed this and even more complicated studies in more than 1000 subjects and achieved the completion rate assumed for this study.

AB  -  The Dinamap 845XT automatic blood pressure monitor, Dinamap 8100 (an update model), and two mercury sphygmomanometers were compared in 417 school‐aged children examined in the spring of 1992 as part of the Bogalusa Heart Study. This study was conducted in the nearby community of Franklinton, Louisiana, to verify data obtained as part of a cross‐sectional survey (1987 to 1988) of school‐aged children in Bogalusa. Systolic blood pressure levels were on the average 3 mm Hg higher on the Dinamap instruments than on the sphygmomanometers. Mean levels of diastolic blood pressure using either Dinamap instrument were slightly higher until eight years of age and then were considerably lower than mercury sphygmomanometer fourth phase readings. Diastolic blood pressure levels on the Dinamap 8100 were 4 mm Hg lower than on the Dinamap 845XT. Height was identified as the predominant predictor variable of differences in diastolic blood pressure between the mercury sphygmomanometer and either Dinamap instrument. A 10% random sample of children was reexamined each screening day in the cross‐sectional survey to estimate measurement errors. The diastolic readings of the Dinamap 845XT had a lower intraclass correlation (0.68) compared to the mercury sphygmomanometers (0.83 fourth phase and 0.76 fifth phase). The Dinamap offers the ease of measuring systolic blood pressure although the diastolic blood pressure appears to be biased and especially low, particularly on the new 8100 model.

AB  -  Background: Hypertension is a major threat to the health of adult individuals in West Africa however, the management and control of hypertension has been poorly managed. Thyroid disorders have been implicated in high blood pressure (BP) of patients with essential hypertension. Currently, there are no data on the frequency with which hypertension may be associated with and caused by thyroid disorders, the treatment of which may restore the elevated BP to normal in individuals in West Africa. The aim of the study is to study whether there is an association between thyroid disorders and hypertension Methods: The study was conducted at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, in Kumasi, West Africa. Participants were randomly selected and their participation was voluntary. Informed consent was obtained from each individual and the study was approved by the University of Science and Technology Medical School. Participants with renal disease, lipid disorders, electrolyte imbalances and diabetes were excluded. Blood pressure was measured with a sphygmomanometer after 30 minutes of rest with the participants and individual with a systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure exceeding 160/95 mm Hg was defined hypertensive. Serum triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were determined by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay technique. Result(s): Based on the serum levels of T4 and TSH, no statistically significant difference (T4 non‐HPT vs T4 HPT, p = 0.18; TSHnon‐HPT vs TSHHPT, p = 0.4) was observed between non‐HPT (T4 = 70.4 +/‐ 13.9 ng/ml; TSH = 1.9 +/‐ 0.9 muIU/ml) and HPT (T4 = 81.1 +/‐ 23.9 ng/ml; TSH = 1.7 +/‐ 1.1 muIU/ml). However, mean serum T3 level of HPTs was statistically greater than that of non‐HPTs (T3 HPT 1.6 +/‐ 0.7 ng/ml and T3 HPT 1.2 +/‐ 0.5 ng/ml, p < 0.03). In univariate analysis, correlation between systolic, but not diastolic, BP and serum level of either T3 or T4 was significant (r = 0.30, p = 0.001 and r = 0.25, p = 0.002 respectively). We did not observe any level of significance between systolic BP and TSH (r = ‐0.13 and p = 0.124). Similar correlation was observed between diastolic BP and serum level of T3 or T4 (r = 0.31, p = 0.001 and r = 0.28, p = 0.001 respectively). As expected, no significant difference between diastolic BP and TSH was noticed (r = ‐0.12 and p = 0.136). In our multivariate analysis, TSH again did not significantly influence systolic or diastolic BP while T3 or T4 strongly influence both systolic and diastolic BP. Relating thyroid hormone levels across the age groups, T3 and T4 levels of HPT were found to be higher than that of non‐HPT in all corresponding age groups except TSH which was higher in 41‐50 year group of HPT than non‐HPT group. There was no significant difference between the ages of both non‐HPT and HPT participants (non‐HPT = 50.6 +/‐ 11.7 and HPT = 51.0 +/‐ 12.4 years). Conclusion(s): These results suggest a close association between T3 and T4 and hypertension.

AB  -  AIMS: To compare the effects of two long‐acting calcium antagonists of different types on cardiovascular stress responses in hypertension. METHODS: One‐hundred and forty‐five patients with mild to moderate hypertension and a mean (+/‐ s.e.mean) age of 51 +/‐ 0.9 years received for 8 weeks the phenylalkylamine verapamil sustained release (240 mg) and the dihydropyridine amlodipine (5 mg) in a double‐blind cross‐over design, both after 4 weeks of placebo. Blood pressure, heart rate and plasma noradrenaline were monitored during 3 min of sustained isometric handgrip and 2 min of cold pressor. RESULTS: Blood pressure was equally reduced by both drugs. After 3 min handgrip, systolic blood pressure, heart rate and rate‐pressure product were lower with verapamil compared with amlodipine. Verapamil attenuated the increases in systolic blood pressure (25 +/‐ 2 vs 30 +/‐ 2 mmHg, difference 4.6, 95% CI (1.0, 8.1), P < 0.01) and rate‐pressure product (3.1 +/‐ 0.2 vs 3.6 +/‐ 0.3 x 10(3) mmHg x beats min(‐1), difference 0.5, 95% CI (0.1, 0.9), P < 0.01) during handgrip compared with amlodipine. Similar results were observed during cold pressor. Plasma noradrenaline levels were lower with verapamil compared with amlodipine at rest and after both tests, but the increases in plasma noradrenaline were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil is more effective in reducing blood pressure and rate‐pressure product responses to stress compared with amlodipine. Although plasma noradrenaline is lower with verapamil at rest and after stress, the increase during stress is not different.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Hypertension has proven to be a strong liability with 13.5% of all mortality worldwide being attributed to elevated blood pressures in 2001. An accurate blood pressure measurement lies at the crux of an appropriate diagnosis. Despite the mercury sphygmomanometer being the gold standard, the ongoing deliberation as to whether mercury sphygmomanometers should be replaced with the automated oscillometric devices stems from the risk mercury poses to the environment. AIM: This study was performed to check the validity of automated oscillometric blood pressure measurements as compared to the manual blood pressure measurements in Karachi, Pakistan. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood pressure was recorded in 200 individuals aged 15 and above using both, an automated oscillometric blood pressure device (Dinamap Procare 100) and a manual mercury sphygmomanometer concomitantly. Two nurses were assigned to each patient and the device, arm for taking the reading and nurses were randomly determined. SPSS version 20 was used for analysis. Mean and standard deviation of the systolic and diastolic measurements from each modality were compared to each other and P values of 0.05 or less were considered to be significant. Validation criteria of British Hypertension Society (BHS) and the US Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) were used. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were included. The mean of the difference of systolic was 8.54 ± 9.38 while the mean of the difference of diastolic was 4.21 ± 7.88. Patients were further divided into three groups of different systolic blood pressure <= 120, > 120 to = 150 and > 150, their means were 6.27 ± 8.39 (p‐value 0.175), 8.91 ± 8.96 (p‐value 0.004) and 10.98 ± 10.49 (p‐value 0.001) respectively. In our study 89 patients were previously diagnosed with hypertension; their difference of mean systolic was 9.43 ± 9.89 (p‐value 0.000) and difference of mean diastolic was 4.26 ± 7.35 (p‐value 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Systolic readings from a previously validated device are not reliable when used in the ER and they show a higher degree of incongruency and inaccuracy when they are used outside validation settings. Also, readings from the right arm tend to be more precise.

AB  -  Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is an important tool in hypertension diagnosis and management. Although several ambulatory devices exist, comparative studies are scarce. This study aimed to compare for the first time brachial blood pressure levels of Spacelabs 90217A and Mobil‐O‐Graph NG, under static and ambulatory conditions. We examined 40 healthy individuals under static (study A) and ambulatory (study B) conditions. In study A, participants were randomized into two groups that included blood pressure measurements with mercury sphygmomanometer, Spacelabs and Mobil‐O‐Graph devices with reverse order of recordings. In study B, simultaneous 6‐h recordings with both devices were performed with participants randomized in two sequences of device positioning with arm reversal at 3 h. Finally, all the participants filled in a questionnaire rating their overall preference for a device. In study A, brachial systolic blood pressure (117.2±10.3 vs 117.1±9.8 mm Hg, P=0.943) and diastolic blood pressure (73.3±9.4 mm Hg vs 74.1±9.4 mm Hg, P=0.611) did not differ between Spacelabs and Mobil‐O‐Graph or vs sphygmomanometer (117.8±11.1 mm Hg, P=0.791 vs Spacelabs, P=0.753 vs Mobil‐O‐Graph). Similarly, no differences were found in ambulatory systolic blood pressure (117.9±11.4 vs 118.3±11.0 mm Hg, P=0.864), diastolic blood pressure (73.7±7.4 vs 74.7±8.0 mm Hg, P=0.571), mean blood pressure and heart rate between Spacelabs and Mobil‐O‐Graph. Correlation analyses and Bland‐Altman plots showed agreement between the monitors. Overall, the participants showed a preference for the Mobil‐O‐Graph. Spacelabs 90217A and Mobil‐O‐Graph NG provide practically identical measurements during the static and ambulatory conditions in healthy individuals and can be rather used interchangeably in clinical practice.

AB  -  1. Although 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been used to measure the change in blood pressure over time due to pharmacological intervention, little has been written about its use to reduce, or eliminate, patients' response to a placebo. 2. Patients eligible for an 8‐week, double‐blind, parallel‐group study comparing the angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril hydrochloride (Accupril®), with placebo had to have mild to moderate hypertension by both clinic (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥100 mm Hg) and ABPM (mean walking DBP [MWDBP] ≥90 mm Hg) measurements at the last placebo baseline visit. MWDBP was defined as the mean DBP during the time period from dose (9 am ± 2 hours) to 8 pm. 3. Of 152 patients with previously diagnosed hypertension who qualified for ABPM, 17 (11%) were eliminated using ABPM measurements as inclusion criteria whereas none would have been eliminated using clinic blood pressures only. Data from 58 of the 69 patients randomized to placebo were evaluable for the efficacy analysis. For the patients treated with placebo, the adjusted mean reduction in MWDBP from baseline was 0.6 mm Hg (SE ± 1.02), versus 2 mm Hg by clinic sphygmomanometer; 24‐hour ABPM results during the placebo baseline were similar to those during the double‐blind treatment. 4. The use of MWDBP as a criterion for randomization appeared to minimize the placebo response over the 8‐week trial and assure that only those patients with raised blood pressure throughout the day were included, thereby allowing a more accurate assessment of treatment effect.

AB  -  Material and Methods 1. Population Subjects will be selected according these inclusion criteria: aged above 35 years, history of type 2 diabetes and mild hypertension (blood pressure < 160 X 100 mmHg) no longer than 15 years, body mass index < 35 Kg/m2, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) between 7,0 e 10,5%. Exclusion criteria are: smoking within the last six months, pregnancy or breastfeeding; creatinine clearance < 45 ml/min/m2 (MDRD); use of NPH (neutral protamine Hagedorn) or/and regular insulin, pioglitazone, GLP‐1 receptor agonist, DPP‐4 inhibitor or acarbose; a serum alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase level of more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range; subjects with ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, other atherosclerotic disease, cancer, or heart failure in functional classes II, III and IV; stress test with typical chest pain or with ST segment depression ≥ 1 mm, with horizontal or descendent and duration of 0.08 seconds after the J point; use of 3 or more anti hypertensive drugs, which characterizes a resistance hypertension; intolerance to metformin, and inability to give informed consent. 1.2 Sample size To calculate the number of patients we used the site: www.lei.dante.br‐pesquisa. The sample will be composed of 25 patients in each arm. The number of patients per group necessary to detect a difference in reactive hyperemia index (RHI) of 0.3 with a power of 80% is 25 patients. And with a two‐tailed t test at the 5% level it was calculated to be 21, with SD of 0.35 for the difference in RHI. The RHI improvement by 0.3 was based on previous study and a drop out rate of 20% was considered. Fifty diabetic and hypertensive patients will be randomized at first visit, submitted to endothelial function testing by the Endo‐PAT 2000 device, and divided into 2 groups: group 1 will receive vildagliptin (100 mg/day, divided in 2 times) added‐on to metformin (500 to 2550 mg/day, according to glycemic control) and group 2 will receive glibenclamide (5 to 20 mg/day, according to glycemic control) added‐on to metformin. Blood samples will be collected after 12‐hour overnight fast at screening visit and 12 weeks after treatment with vildagliptin (group 1) and glibenclamide (group 2). At screening, renin angiotensin system blockers will be added for all subjects, and other antihypertensive drugs will be maintained. All patients will give informed consent after the study be approved by the local Institutional Review Board. 1.3 Blood Pressure The blood pressure (BP) measurement technique will be made according VI Brazilian Guidelines to Hypertension Treatment: 1) measurements were taken with a recently calibrated aneroid sphygmomanometer known to be accurate; 2) the cuff was placed so that the lower edge was 3 cm above the elbow crease and the bladder was centered over the brachial artery; 3) a standard bladder was used (12‐13 cm long and 35 cm wide), but a larger and a smaller bladder were available for thicker and thinner arms, respectively; 4) the arm was bare and supported with the blood pressure cuff positioned at heart level; 5) the mean of three BP measurements taken in the sitting position after 5 to 10 minutes of rest was used; 6) phase I and V (disappearance) Korotkoff sounds were used to identify systolic and diastolic BP, respectively; 7) the pressure was increased rapidly to 30 mmHg above the level at which the radial pulse was extinguished; 8) a cuff deflation rate of 2 mmHg per beat was used; 9) a minimum of 1‐minute intervals were recommended between readings to avoid venous congestion; 10) BP was measured in both arms to detect possible differences due to peripheral vascular disease; in this case, the higher value was taken as the reference one. Hypertension is defined as systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg or current use of anti‐hypertensive drugs. 1.3 Anthropometric Measure Weight and height will be measured by anthropometric scale and body mass index (BMI) will obtained by the formula: BMI = weight (Kg) / (height in meters)2. 1.4 Randomisation A computer‐generated randomisation list will be delivered by the Research Center of the glibenclamide/vildagliptin group. 2. Laboratory Blood sample will be drawn after 12 hours fast to measure triglycerides, total cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol, glycemia, serum creatinine, ultrasensitive reactive C protein (RCP), Alanine aminotransferase and HbA1c. Microalbuminuria also will be evaluated. Diabetic subjects will be identified by history of diabetes with dietetic treatment for diabetes or in use of hypoglycemic drugs. Subjects will be considered diabetic after 2 fasting glucose more than 125 mg/dl, according with National Diabetes Data Group. Serum cholesterol will be evaluated according Brazilian Guideline of Dyslipidemia. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) will be calculated by the Friedewald formula for triglycerides (TG) levels below 400 mg/dL ( LDLc = TC ‐ HDLc ‐ TG/5 (para TG < 400 mg/dL). Total Cholesterol (TC); high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc). 3. Treadmill test At screening visit all selected subjects will be submitted for coronary disease evaluation by stress test. Subjects with stress test with typical chest pain or with ST segment depression ≥ 1 mm, with horizontal or descendent and duration of 0.08 seconds after the J point will be excluded. 4. Endothelium function Pulse amplitude tonometry (Endo‐PAT 2000; Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel) is a peripheral endothelium function test, a non‐invasive determination of digital endothelium function. This test will be performed following a light breakfast in the morning after 20 min rest and with the patient in a supine position. The PAT device is placed on the tip of each index finger and comprises a pneumatic pletysmography that applies a uniform pressure to the surface of the distal finger, allowing measurement of pulse volume changes. The inflation pressure of the digital device is electronically set to 10 mmHg below diastolic blood pressure or 70 mmHg. The PAT signal is recorded at baseline and following 5 min arterial occlusion using a inflatable cuff, while the contralateral arm serves as a control. The blood pressure cuff is inflated to 60 mmHg higher than systolic pressure or at least 200 mmHg for 5 min. Lack of residual pulsatility is monitored throughout the occlusion period. The post‐occlusive hyperemia stimulates endothelium‐dependent vasodilatation, causing an increase in digital pulse amplitude. Pulse amplitude is recorded electronically in both fingers and analysed by a computerised, automated algorithm (Itamar Medical). The change from the baseline measurement is expressed as the reactive hyperemia index (RHI), which in part reflects vasodilator function of the digital microcirculation. Subjects will be instructed to fast starting the night before testing and to refrain from ingesting alcohol or caffeine. Room temperature will be maintained at all time during the study between 21º C and 24° C; restrictive clothing that could interfere with blood flow to the arms, watches or rings or other jewellery on the hands will be removed. The patient will be comfortably seated or allowed to lie down in the study room for at least 15 min to reach a relaxed cardiovascular steady‐state. The subjects for the study will be submitted to the endothelium function test at first visit and 12 weeks after treatment. Endothelial dysfunction is defined as 2.34±0.33 less than 2 standard deviations (SD) of 20 healthy asymptomatic control individuals without history of cardiovascular disease and without major risk factors, corresponding to RHI ≤ 1,6837. 5. Central Arterial Pressure The applanation tonometry from the radial artery is a non‐invasive method assessing arterial stiffness, which is predictive of vascular disease. A portion of the artery pressure wave travelling towards the extremities is reflected back from peripheral impedance points. In healthy individuals, the reflected wave returns to the aorta during diastole. When arteries become stiff, the transit time for de incident and reflected waves is reduced. Thus, the reflected wave returns to the aorta during systole of the same cardiac cycle augmenting the central blood pressures. This augmenting of central pressure can be quantified by augmentation index (AIx). AIx has been associated with cardiovascular risk, predicts the presence or absence of coronary artery disease40. Higher values of AIx indicate increased wave reflection from periphery or earlier return of the reflected wave as a result of increased pulse velocity, which can be contributed to an increased arterial stiffness. In young healthy individuals, the systolic arterial pressure (aortic) is about 20 mmHg less than the peripheral systolic pressure (brachial). The applanation tonometry from the radial artery will be performed in the randomised subjects at the first visit and 12 weeks after the treatment. Statistical analysis The continuous variables will be analyzed using the Student's t‐test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data will be presented as mean ± 1 SD for continuous variables and as frequencies for categorical variables. The chi‐squared test will be utilized for the comparative study between the groups in use of vildagliptin with those in use of glibenclamide. Logistical regression will be performed for associations with statistical significance. An alpha error of 5% was considered acceptable giving significance with p‐value<0.05. Pharmacovigilance requirements: Any serious adverse events will be reported to the Ethics Committee of the FAMERP within 24 hours of the occurrence. All serious adverse events will also be reported to Novartis Drug Safety & Epidemiology (DS&E) within 24 hours of the investigator (or designee) being aware of the serious adverse event. Specific definitions of adverse events, and serious adverse events, are outlined below, along with reporting criteria required by Novartis. Adverse events (AE) Information about all AEs, whether volunteered by the patient, discovered by investigator questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be collected and recorded on an Adverse Event Case Report Form and will be followed up as appropriate. An AE is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after starting study treatment, even if the event is not considered to be treatment‐related. Study treatment includes the study medication under evaluation, and any reference or placebo drug (or therapy) given during any phase of the trial. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment will only be considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol). Adverse events (but not serious adverse events) occurring before starting study treatment but after signing the informed consent form will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions Case Report Form. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant or require therapy, and are recorded on the Adverse Events Case Report Form under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them. As far as possible, each adverse event will also be described by: 1. its duration (start and end dates), 2. the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe), 3. its relationship to the study drug (suspected / not suspected), 4. the action(s) taken.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: In type 1 diabetic patients with nephropathy, tight blood pressure control has been shown to prevent the progression of the disease. Up until now, self‐monitoring, ambulatory and office blood pressure values have not been compared in these patients. Thus, we have evaluated blood pressure values obtained in the office by a physician and at home by self‐monitoring with those measured under ambulatory conditions in these patients. Additionally, for blood pressure self‐monitoring, three different devices (the sphygmomanometer, upper‐arm oscillometer and wrist oscillometer) were compared. METHODS: Twenty‐one treated hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients [age 45+/‐9 years, duration of diabetes 33+/‐12 years (mean+/‐SD)] with overt diabetic nephropathy participated in this study. At both baseline and the end of the study, daytime ambulatory blood pressure measurement was performed. Office blood pressure was measured at baseline. Additionally, all the patients measured their blood pressure over a 3‐week period using each of the three different devices, in random order, for 1 week. RESULTS: The mean office blood pressure values (135+/‐21/85+/‐12mmHg) were higher than both the ambulatory (131+/‐23/80+/‐12, P<0.05) and self‐monitoring values (130+/‐14/78+/‐10; P<0.05 for systolic and P<0.02 for diastolic values). The difference between the ambulatory and self‐monitoring values were not statistically significant. Diastolic blood pressure values measured with the oscillometric wrist device showed a trend towards higher values when compared to those measured with the sphygmomanometer and with the oscillometric upper‐arm device (P=0.065 for diastolic values). CONCLUSION: Office blood pressure measurements may over‐estimate blood pressure in patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Because the oscillometric wrist device tends to over‐estimate diastolic values, upper‐arm devices should be preferred for blood pressure self‐monitoring in these patients.

AB  -  Introduction: The impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on blood pressure (BP) is not well established. Previous studies presented one or more of the following limitations: 1. Adherence to antihypertensive medications was not performed; 2. Inclusion of patients with controlled BP at baseline; 3. Absence of a placebo arm; 4. No systematical exclusion of secondary hypertension (HTN). Aims: Evaluate the impact of OSA treatment with CPAP on central BP. Methods: The MORPHEOS is an ongoing multicenter (n=5) Brazilian randomized study designed to measure the cardiovascular impact of 6 months' treatment with CPAP or placebo (nasal strips) in patients with uncontrolled HTN and moderate to severe OSA (apnea‐hypopnea index, AHI, >15 events/h by portable sleep monitoring ‐ Embletta GoldTM). Uncontrolled HTN was defined by office systolic BP â‰¥140mmHg OR diastolic BP â‰¥90mmHg AND elevation on at least one parameter of 24‐hour ambulatory BP monitoring despite the regular use (evaluated by pill count for one month ‐ run‐in period) of at least one antihypertensive medication. The primary endpoint is central BP (SphygmoCor). Secondary outcomes include office B P, 24‐hour ambulatory B P, target‐organ damage as evaluated by echocardiography (Vivid E95) and arterial stiffness by pulse wave velocity (Complior). The patients are followed every week (first month) and once a month there after. During the follow‐up, we performed adherence to medications by pill count and standard procedures for checking OSA and nasal strips use. Results: This ongoing study evaluated 345 patients. Ninety‐four patients (27%) were excluded due to BP control at study entry and 22 (6%) during the run‐in period. In addition, 18 participants (5%) were excluded due to secondary HTN, 76 (22%) due to an AHI <15 events/h and 33 (10%) due to other causes. So far, 102 patients were randomized (67% men, age 53Â±9 years, body mass index 32.6Â±3.9Kg/ m2). Co‐morbidities were common in this population (for instance, dyslipidemia 49%, diabetes mellitus 37%). The AHI was 42Â±24 events/h and lowest oxygen saturation was 76Â±8%. The office systolic BP was 152Â±13 mmHg and office diastolic BP was 93Â±12 mmHg. Conclusions: The MORPHEOS is intending to surpass the main limitations of the previous studies to explore the cardiovascular impact of OSA treatment with CPAP in patients with HTN.

AB  -  The effects of self‐monitoring of blood pressure on the control of hypertension were examined in this study. Failure of patients to comply with treatment is presumably attributable in part to the fact that hypertension usually is asymptomatic until complications develop. Self‐monitoring might make visible an otherwise asymptomatic condition, and thereby increase motivation. One hundred hypertensive patients beginning outpatient treatment were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Subjects were given a sphygmomanometer and instructed in its use. Both groups were given similar antihypertensive medications. After six months of treatment, mean systolic pressure was significantly lower (11.4 mm Hg, p smaller than 0.05) in the experimental than in the control subjects. However, the mean baseline systolic pressure in the control group was 3.9 mm Hg less than that of the experimental group. If this value is substracted from the difference between the last mean systolic pressures in the two groups, the 7.5 mm Hg difference is seen as a very modest effect of self‐monitoring. Diastolic blood pressure was insignificantly lower for experimental subjects. Compared to the potent effectiveness of drugs in reducing blood pressure, self‐monitoring was of little value.

AB  -  The duration of antihypertensive action of the alpha‐adrenergic blocking agent, prazosin, was studied in 12 hypertensive patients in whom twice‐daily doses of this agent were found to be effective and well tolerated during a preliminary titration period. The patients then entered a cross‐over phase of study. On a randomized basis, they were given prazosin either twice daily for eight weeks followed by an eight‐week period in which they received the same total dose once daily (each morning), or they were given the treatment for a once‐daily period followed by a twice‐daily period. Using the conventional sphygmomanometer, there were no significant differences in blood pressures for the patients as a whole between the measurements during once‐daily dosage (measured approximately 24 hours after the last administration of drug) and those during twice‐daily dosage (measured approximately 12 hours after the last administration); but for both methods of administration, blood pressures were significantly lower than pre‐treatment values. Automated whole‐day ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed a tendency for blood pressures to be lower with once‐daily than with twice‐daily treatment during the first 12 hours after the morning doses were given, but there was a reversal of this pattern during the early morning hours preceding the next dose. However, for at least half of the patients these differences were only minimal. Thus, prazosin may be effective in some patients as once‐daily treatment, especially after several weeks of therapy. Moreover, automated whole‐day blood pressure monitoring appears to be a valuable technique for guiding dosage requirements for patients on an individual basis.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: To measure recruitment to, compliance with, and the acceptability of a trial designed to test whether a reduced schedule of antenatal visits combined with training in self‐measurement of blood pressure at home may improve hypertension screening and save money. To test the specific hypothesis that even after taking into account extra unscheduled visits, the reduced schedule with ambulatory monitoring reduces total visits. DESIGN: A pilot randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Four urban and four rural general practices in Yorkshire and Lancashire. POPULATION: One hundred and five low risk women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Eighty women participated. INTERVENTION: Women were invited to participate at 24‐28 weeks. Those who accepted were allocated either to a standard nine subsequent visit schedule (30, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 weeks) or to a reduced schedule (34, 38, 41 weeks). Those in the latter group measured their blood pressure weekly using a portable sphygmomanometer at home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recruitment, total number of clinic visits, frequency of blood pressure measurement, schedule preference, and anxiety. RESULTS: Although there were more unscheduled visits in the home monitoring group, this did not outweigh the reduction in scheduled visits, (total visits reduced from 7 x 4 to 4 x 5, P < 0 x 001), and blood pressure was measured during more weeks (9 vs 7 weeks, P < 0 x 001) in the experimental group. Most women expressed a preference for the reduced schedule both when the idea was first suggested, and after they had experienced it, and there were no significant differences in anxiety. CONCLUSION: Replacement of antenatal screening visits with home blood pressure monitoring is acceptable to women. The reduction in clinic visits is not compensated by an increase in visits for other reasons and overall blood pressure measurement is omitted less often. Whether it reduces adverse outcomes or has any rare side effects will require a larger trial, but this pilot study indicates that it is likely to be safe, and that such a large trial would be feasible.

AB  -  In this study, a recently marketed proprietary finger blood pressure monitor, the Marshall, Astro F‐88, was compared with the standard auscultative brachial mercury sphygmomanometer on 125 subjects. Measurements were undertaken according to the standards set by the American Heart Association. Sensitivity of the finger blood pressure measurement was 76% for systolic and 75% for diastolic blood pressure in diagnosis of high blood pressure (systolic greater than 140 mm Hg and diastolic greater than 90 mm Hg). Specificity was 86% for systolic and 82% for diastolic blood pressure. Positive predictive values were 58% for systolic and 38% for diastolic blood pressure in the study population in which prevalence of hypertension was 12%. The correlation coefficient (Pearson) for systolic values between devices was 0.76 (P less than .0001) and 0.57 (P less than .0001) for diastolic pressure. Values obtained by the finger monitor were found to be higher than those obtained by the mercury sphygmomanometer. Mean differences and standard deviations (paired t test) for systolic and diastolic pressures between the two devices were 2.3 +/‐ 14.9 mm Hg (P less than .08) and 2.9 +/‐ 14.5 mm Hg (P less than .02), respectively. These values are not in accordance with the proposed national standards because only 48% of the systolic and 37% of the diastolic blood pressure measurements were within 5 mm Hg of the mercury sphygmomanometer measurements. Therefore, although these differences may well be due to different techniques of monitoring employed by the devices, this device is not recommended for evaluation of blood pressure.

AB  -  The main purpose of this study is to estimate the influence of taking a number of placebo tablets to obtain hypotensive effects and some psychological parameters with essential hypertension. 197 patients (102F/95M) aged between 18‐80 years (average age 52.3) with essential hypertension were included in the research in two outpatients clinics. The patients who participated in research, stayed for at least seven days without any pharmacological treatment. They had a diastolic pressure (DBP) between 95‐114 mm Hg and systolic pressure (SBP) up to 200 mm Hg. 92 patients had taken one tablet a day and 105 patients had taken two tablets in the morning. This was before the placebo was included and two weeks after their blood pressure had been taken by standard methods (sphygmomanometer). They were monitored daily throughout the period using traditional methods and ABPM (SpaceLabs 90121). The patients completed two psychological tests. 97 records (52F/45M) qualified for statistical analysis (80% of measurements were undertaken properly, and the time between measurements was less than two hours). Psychological questionnaires were correctly completed by 92 patients. The visible results of decreasing systolic and diastolic value of blood pressure were obtained after using one (group 1) and two (group 2) placebo tablets. They were monitored by a standard method and recorded by ABPM. In group 1 SBP decreased from 164 +/‐ 11.4 mm Hg to 158 +/‐ 8.8 mm Hg (p < 0.01, on standard method) and from 149.5 +/‐ 17.8 to 144.5 +/‐ 8.3 mm Hg daily (p < 0.05, ABPM). DBP in this examined group decreased from 106.2 +/‐ 2.8 to 102 +/‐ 3.9 mm Hg (p < 0.01, stand. method), and from 103.2 +/‐ 2.6 to 98.6 +/‐ 1.2 mm Hg daily (p < 0.05, ABPM). In the second group SBP decreased from 169 +/‐ 12.8 to 157.6 +/‐ 17.9 mm Hg (p < 0.001, stand. method), and in ABPM from 148.5 +/‐ 15.8 to 139.6 +/‐ 16.2 mm Hg (p < 0.01). In this same group, DBP decreased from 104.4 +/‐ 2.6 to 98 +/‐ 3.4 mm hG (p < 0.001, stand. method), and from 107.4 +/‐ 5.8 mm Hg to 95.5 +/‐ 4.2 mm Hg‐daily (p < 0.001, ABPM). There were no differences between heart rate in all groups of patients. In both groups there were significant statistical differences in negative symptoms, physical symptoms and anexity, but a more optimistic mood was observed by group 2. More effective hypertensive treatment was observed within the group which was treated with two placebo tablets. This group was characterized by more optimistic mood compared to the group which was treated with one placebo tablet a day.

AB  -  The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) reported that some older, higher risk patients might benefit from a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of <120 versus <140 mm Hg. However, it is not yet known how the BP target and measurement methods used in SPRINT relate to cardiovascular outcomes in real‐world practice. SPRINT used the automated office BP technique, which requires the patient to be resting quietly and alone, with multiple readings being recorded automatically using an electronic oscillometric sphygmomanometer. We studied the relationship between achieved automated office BP at baseline and cardiovascular events in 6183 community‐dwelling residents of Ontario aged ≥66 years who were receiving antihypertensive therapy and followed for a mean of 4.6 years. Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were computed for 10 mm Hg increments in achieved automated office BP at baseline using Cox proportional hazards regression and the BP category with the lowest event rate as the reference category. Based on 904 fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, the nadir of cardiovascular events was at the systolic pressure category of 110 to 119 mm Hg, which was lower than the next highest category of 120 to 129 mm Hg (hazard ratio 1.30 [1.01, 1.66]). The hazard ratio for diastolic pressure was relatively unchanged above 60 mm Hg. Pulse pressure exhibited an increase in hazard ratio (1.33 [1.02, 1.72]) at ≥80 mm Hg. These results using automated office BP measurement in a usual treatment setting extend the finding in SPRINT of an optimum target systolic BP of <120 mm Hg to routine clinical practice.

AB  -  Acute resistance exercise can reduce the blood pressure (BP) of hypertensive subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different volumes of acute low‐intensity resistance exercise over the magnitude and the extent of BP changes in treated hypertensive elderly individuals. Sixteen participants (7 men, 9 women), with mean age of 68 ± 5 years, performed 3 independent randomized sessions: Control (C: 40 minutes of rest), Exercise 1 (E1: 20 minutes, 1 lap in the circuit), and Exercise 2 (E2: 40 minutes, 2 laps in the circuit) with the intensity of 40% of 1 repetition maximum. Blood pressure was measured before (during 20 minutes) and after each session (every 5 minutes during 60 minutes) using both a mercury sphygmomanometer and a semiautomatic device (Omrom‐HEM‐431). After that, 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed (Dyna‐MAPA). Blood pressure decreased during the first 60 minutes (systolic: p < 0.01, diastolic: p < 0.05) after all exercise sessions. Only the highest volume session promoted a reduction of mean systolic 24‐hour BP and awake BP (p < 0.05) after exercise, with higher diastolic BP during sleep (p < 0.05). Diastolic 24‐hour BP and both systolic and diastolic BP during sleep were higher after E1 (p < 0.05). Concluding, acute resistive exercise sessions in a circuit with different volumes reduced BP during the first 60 minutes after exercise in elderly individuals with treated hypertension. However, only the highest volume promoted a reduction of mean 24‐hour and awake systolic BP.

AB  -  Objective: The PAMELA is an epidemiological study performed on a population sample, including office, home and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements. Measurements were made at baseline, after 11 years, and repeated in a 3rd survey 26 years later. Design and method: 3200 subjects were randomly selected to represent the population of Monza (North Italy) aged 25‐74 years. In each subject body mass index (BMI), office (sphygmomanometer), home (semiautomatic validated device), 24 h (validated automatic oscillometric device) systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP measurements, heart rate (HR) and biochemical variables were obtained. All values were measured at baseline (1st survey, 1990‐91), 11 years later (2nd survey, 2001‐02) and after further 15 years (3rd survey, 2016‐17). Results: 562 subjects (279/283 males/females, mean age 41 Â± 10 yrs) participated at the 3 surveys. Baseline average office, home and 24 h SBP/DBP were respectively 122/81 Â± 14/9, 116/73 Â± 15/10, 116/73 Â± 9/7 mmHg and increased respectively of 5/1 Â± 14/9, 4/1 Â± 14/9 and 4/2 Â± 10/7 mmHg at the 2nd survey. At the 3rd survey a further increase of 11/2 Â± 7/11, 8/3 Â± 16/10 and 13/2 Â± 15/9 mmHg was observed in office, home and 24 h BP respectively. The baseline‐3rd survey office, home and 24 h SBP difference was unrelated to age, while the DBP increase was inversely related to age (r = ‐0.32, ‐0.39 and ‐0.38, respectively, P < 0.0001). The baseline‐3rd survey increase in office, home and 24 h DBP was significantly directly related to the concomitant BMI increase (r = 0.23, 0.17 and 0.14, respectively, P < 0.005). Office and home HR was similar in the 3 surveys. A reduction in 24 h HR was detected between the 1st and 3rd survey (‐4.0 Â± 8.2 b/min). At baseline hypertensive subjects were 22.2% (office BP), 19.3% (home BP) and 20.7% (24 h BP), and increased to 37.7%, 33.8% and 43.5% at the 2nd survey and to 68.7%, 65.8% and 80.8% at the 3rd survey respectively. Conclusions: The PAMELA 26‐year follow‐up represents the longest survey ever done describing the long‐term changes of BP measurements in general population. It shows a long‐term increase in office, home and 24 h BP only partially accompanied by HR changes, and an increase in the prevalence of hypertension, particularly pronounced when defined with 24 h measurements.

AB  -  Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a measure of arterial stiffness and predicts incident cardiovascular risk. Studies show ACE‐Is and ARBs effectively improve measures of arterial stiffness, including PWV. However, many of these studies have shown conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of ACE‐I and ARB antihypertensive therapy among aging female population. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed, including level of the renin‐angiotensin pathway contribution to hypertension in postmenopausal women. We hypothesized postmenopausal women would exhibit differential vascular responses to ACE‐I and ARB antihypertensive therapy when compared to their agematched male counterparts. The CALIBREX trial, a double‐blind randomized controlled trial compared candesartan to lisinopril (doses titrated to SBP <130, DBP <80 mmHg) on measures of vascular and cognitive function; 140 hypertensive adults (age 55‐89 y/o, 59% female) with mild cognitive impairment were enrolled. PWV was measured at baseline and 1 year using the Sphygmocor device (Atcor Medical) and the change in PWV was adjusted for baseline PWV, age, race, BMI, and baseline and 1 year systolic blood pressure (SBP). Overall, the change in SBP after 1 year with Candesartan (140 ± 21 to 135 ± 13 mmHg) and Lisinopril (145 ± 21 to 130 ± 11 mmHg) was similar, p=0.82. The change in SBP among males and females in both groups was also similar . After 1 year, both men and women had a reduction in PWV with Lisinopril (9.4 m/s ± 3.6 to 9.0 m/s ± 2.3 p=0.13 in men; 9.3 m/s ± 3.1 to 8.6 m/s ± 2.3 p=0.063 in women) whereas with candesartan, PWV did not change in men but increased in women (8.8 m/s ± 2.7 to 9.0 m/s ± 2.4 p<0.002 in men; 8.5 m/s ± 2.6 to 9.0 m/s ± 2.2 p<0.002 in women). After adjustment for the aforementioned covariates, both sex and drug remained independent predictors of the change in PWV. In conclusion, we demonstrate sex differences in the vascular effects of ARBs compared to ACE‐I, despite similar changes in SBP. Whereas ACE‐I improve arterial stiffness in both sexes, the changes with ARBs are modest with worsening in women.

AB  -  An open crossover trial was conducted to compare the effects of 2 long‐acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, amlodipine (5 to 10 mg/day) and nifedipine GITS (gastrointestinal therapeutic system) [30 to 60 mg/day], in 40 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Particular attention was given to performance of the 2 drugs during the early morning hours. Each phase of treatment lasted 12 weeks. After an initial drug washout period (and at the end of each phase), 24‐hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed. In addition, sphygmomanometric measurements were obtained at regular intervals during treatment. Both drugs significantly reduced sitting blood pressure (measured with a sphygmomanometer) and daytime, night‐time and 24‐hour mean ambulatory blood pressures; on the basis of these parameters, no significant differences were found between the 2 drugs. However, multivariate analysis of ABPM data revealed that amlodipine had greater antihypertensive efficacy than nifedipine GITS (in terms of systolic and diastolic reductions) between 0500 and 1100 hours (p < 0.02 vs nifedipine GITS).

AB  -  In a parallel double‐blind multicentre study, 375 hypertensive patients were enrolled and treated with either the angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) zofenopril 30 mg once daily (titration 60 mg od) or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist losartan 50 mg od (titration 100 mg od). Patients with mild to moderate hypertension, defined as a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 110 mmHg in the sitting position without other signs of cardiovascular disease were enrolled and treated for 12 weeks. BP was assessed in the clinic, and self‐measured by the patients at home during a working day and a holiday, as well as before and at the clinic follow‐ups. Systolic (SBP) and DBP were significantly reduced in both treatment groups to a similar extent at the end of the 12‐week study. However, the immediate or early reduction of DBP as well as DBP reduction over the first month was significantly greater with zofenopril (p= 0 .01 and p= 0 .003, respectively) compared with losartan treatment. After 3 months of treatment and dose up‐titration, clinic BP reductions were similar in both groups. However, more subjects with losartan had used a higher dose step (42.1%) compared with zofenopril (33.1%). Home BP assessments demonstrated that systolic and diastolic pressures were substantially lower than the BP measurements made by sphygmomanometer in the clinic. In particular, assessments 2‐3 days before the clinic visits during working days and holidays were characteristically lower, while the measurements during the clinic visits were largely similar to the conventional BP measurements by the doctor. The number and the severity of adverse events, related to the study medications, were largely benign and similar in both groups. The present study demonstrates that zofenopril in clinically recommended doses is at least therapeutically equivalent to losartan treatment, when assessed by conventional sphygmomanometry at the doctor's office or at home by self‐measured BP assessments by the patients. Zofenopril however, induces a more rapid initial lowering of BP over the first month of therapy.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) on blood pressure (BP) in postmenopausal hypertensive women. METHODS: Sixty women affected by hypertension were enrolled and randomized in two groups of treatment: transdermal continuous HRT in a sequential regimen (group A) and placebo (group P). At baseline, after 3 and 6 months of treatment, the BP with standard sphygmomanometer and with 24‐h ambulatory recording method was evaluated in two periods (from day 10 through day 16 of the cycle and from day 20 through day 27 of the cycle). At the same time, we also evaluated total cholesterol, LDL‐c, HDL‐c, triglycerides, and fibrinogen levels. RESULTS: After 3 and 6 months of treatment, no significant variations of systolic and diastolic BP measured with standard sphygmomanometer were detected in both groups. On the contrary, in group A in comparison with basal values and group P, and without difference between the two phases of treatment, the 24‐h recording showed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in BP. No significant variations were detected in group P versus baseline. In particular, we observed in group A at 3 months of treatment a significant (P<0.05) decrease only in daytime BP in comparison with basal values and group P, without difference between the two phases of treatment. Indeed, the decrease in daytime BP was significant (P<0.05) for both systolic and diastolic BP. At 3 and 6 months a significant (P<0.05) decrease in total cholesterol, LDL‐c and fibrinogen levels was detected in group A versus baseline and group P. HDL‐c and triglyceride concentrations showed no significant variations. CONCLUSIONS: The transdermal HRT induces a significant reduction of BP values and a favorable metabolic action in postmenopausal hypertensive patients.

AB  -  We compared two types of automatic non‐invasive blood pressure measuring device with sphygmomanometry in 47 normotensive and 38 hypertensive women in the third trimester of pregnancy. an automatic oscillometric device (Accutor) and a volume‐clamp device (Finapres) significantly underestimated the diastolic pressure as measured by the fourth Korotkoff sound using a Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer. The mean difference between the sphygmomanometer and Accutor measurement of diastolic blood pressure was +3.1 mmHg in the normotensive women and +8.3 mmHg in the hypertensive women (P = 0.001). The mean difference between the sphygmomanometer and Finapres measurement of diastolic blood pressure was +6.1 mmHg in the normotensive women and +11.5 mmHg in hypertensive women (P = 0.003). The increased use of continuous non‐invasive devices to monitor blood pressure in women with hypertension should be accompanied by sound knowledge of their limitations in this group of patients.

AB  -  Fifteen hypertensive patients were recruited from a geriatric medicine clinic for a "research project designed to evaluate a Behavioral Stepped‐Care treatment program of high blood pressure (HBP)." All patients met the selection criteria of the Isolated Systolic Hypertension (ISH) in the Elderly (SHEP) clinical trial. During baseline, subjects recorded BP at home 9 times/day (3 times each, shortly after awakening, during the middle of the day, and within an hour of retiring) for 1 month and mailed that data to us daily. In addition, they came to the clinic weekly and had their BP recorded by a nurse. During treatment 1, systolic (SBP) feedback, they were trained to lower SBP at home using their sphygmomanometers. They also continued to monitor BP and to obtain weekly professional BP readings. During treatment 2 (relaxation), they were trained to relax; they followed the self‐administration and data‐collection protocol as in treatment 1. Each treatment phase lasted 3 months. Average monthly self‐determined BP fell significantly from 166.4/85.8 (SBP/DBP) mm Hg during baseline to 153.3/81.2 by the end of the relaxation phase; average monthly professionally measured BP fell significantly, from 164.7/87.1 to 156.9/81.5. These findings show that a nurse‐supervised, patient‐administered behavioral treatment program of ISH can yield sustained, significant falls in BP.

AB  -  This was a multicentre randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group study to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril at 3 mg with 12 mg once daily, as determined by 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), in patients with mild to severe essential hypertension. Following a 4‐week placebo run‐in phase, 52 male and female outpatients, aged 23‐67 years with mild to severe essential hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 100 mmHg and < 120 mmHg] were randomized to receive spirapril at either 3 mg or 12 mg once daily for 8 weeks. At the end of active treatment and using the standard mercury sphygmomanometer, the number of responders (sitting DBP < 90 mmHg, but decrease > or = 10 mmHg) was the same in both groups (32% and 37%). There were mean decrease in both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP at trough with both 3 mg and 12 mg doses: ‐9/‐7 mmHg and ‐12/‐7 mmHg, respectively. The rate of normalization (trough DBP < or = 90 mmHg) was 12% and 30% with the 3 mg and 12 mg doses, respectively. Of the 44 patients whose daytime ABPM could be compared, one of 20 patients taking 3 mg of spirapril, and 9 of 24 taking 12 mg of spirapril achieved a DBP < or = 90 mmHg for all time intervals while awake. The differences in blood pressure‐lowering were significant with both SBP and DBP during the day and at the end of the dosing interval (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). The changes from baseline at 24 hours postdose for SBP/DBP were ‐3/‐6 mmHg with 3 mg and ‐14/‐12 mmHg with 12 mg of spirapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  -  The evaluation of mild to moderate hypertension must be carried out under the conditions in which treatments are usually prescribed, i.e., in general practice. After specific training of the physicians in the methods used, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of verapamil by comparing it with a reference drug: captopril. The main assessment criterion was the restoration of normal blood pressure in mildly to moderately hypertensive patients (blood pressure in excess of 160/95 mmHg). Blood pressure was evaluated by two methods: a mercury column sphygmomanometer, after the patient had rested in a half‐sitting position for 10 minutes, and the ambulatory measurement of blood pressure (AMBP) using the SpaceLabs system. The results of this study involving 40 patients followed up for 3 months by 8 GPs in collaboration with our blood pressure unit were as follows: on verapamil, 47% of patients recovered normal values after 30 days of treatment and 71% after 60 days (with no change in dosage). On captopril, the normalization rates were 22 and 27% respectively. The highly significant reduction of blood pressure found by the "occasional" measurement for both treatments (p less than 0.001) was only faintly reflected by AMBP. Verapamil induced a reduction of nighttime blood pressure with no significant impact on heart rate. The clinical, paraclinical and electrocardiographic safety of both treatments was good.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: To compare the short‐term reproducibility of four diagnostic tests: resting blood pressure, exercise blood pressure, non‐invasive daytime ambulatory blood pressure and echocardiographic left ventricular mass. DESIGN: Blinded, prospective test‐retest (reliability) study. SETTING: Hypertension research units in two teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Six normal volunteers and 22 patients with untreated borderline to mild hypertension, mean age 44 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The intraclass correlation coefficient (RI) and standard deviation of the difference (SDD) between visits. MAIN RESULTS: The mean blood pressures and left ventricular mass did not differ between visits. Concordance between visits reached RI = 0.86 systolic/0.66 diastolic for ambulatory blood pressure and RI = 0.85 systolic/0.64 diastolic for nurse‐measured random‐zero sphygmomanometer resting blood pressure. The respective variabilities were SDD = 9/8 and 8/8 mmHg. Submaximal exercise systolic blood pressure (SBP) and echo left ventricular mass showed excellent reliability. Echo left ventricular mass and resting SBP or ambulatory SBP were significantly more reproducible than resting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) or ambulatory DBP. CONCLUSIONS: Despite averaging many readings within each day, clinically important between‐visit variations in ambulatory blood pressure remained. The between‐visit variability of daytime ambulatory blood pressure was similar to that of resting blood pressure when carefully measured by a research nurse. The echo left ventricular mass appears to be more reproducible over the short term than the current diagnostic standard for hypertension, the resting DBP.

AB  -  Background: Hypertension is a silent killer. Each year hypertension contributes to the deaths of nearly 9.4 million people. Non‐pharmacological management may use a combination of the therapy of foot soaks in warm water and progressive muscle relaxation. Aim: The purpose of this study was to find out the effectiveness of the combination of the treatment of foot absorbs in warm water and progressive muscle relaxation in blood pressure for the elderly with hypertension. Methods: This study used a quasi‐experimental design with the pretest and posttest control group design. The sample is consisting of 2 groups, 20 respondents in each group. Examples were selected by simple random sampling technique. The instruments were observation sheet, standard operating procedure, and sphygmomanometer digital. The data were analyzed using the paired t‐test. Results: The mean blood pressures pretest and posttest among control group were 160.70/88.37 mmHg and 160.25/88.67 mmHg. The mean blood pressure pretest and posttest among intervention group were 159.81/85.75 mmHg and 150.31/84.25 mmHg. The decrease in mean pre‐posttest systolic and diastolic pressures in the intervention group were ‐9.50 mmHg and ‐1.50 mmHg. This study found that the treatment useful to reduce systolic (p0.030) and diastolic (p0.0.41). The comparison of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of intervention with the control group obtained p0.018 and 0.023. Conclusion: The combination of the therapy of foot soaks in warm water, and progressive muscle relaxation is useful for lowering blood pressure. Respondents are expected to apply this treatment as a complementary therapy of hypertension.

AB  -  Background/Objectives: Two‐piece blood pressure (BP) cuffs, which contain a removable bladder enclosed within a fabric shell, are the historical cuff standard. Use of one‐piece cuffs, in which the bladder is formed by a potential space within the fabric shell, is increasing. Substituting onepiece for two‐piece cuffs has an unknown effect on measurement accuracy. We compared these cuff types in a two‐phase study using auscultatory (Phase 1) and oscillometric (Phase 2) techniques. Subjects/Methods: Community‐dwelling, consenting subjects (aged >=18y) with BP levels between 80‐220 mmHg/50‐120 mmHg and arm circumferences between 25‐43 cm were studied using the International Standards Organization (ISO) 2013 protocol (with modifications). A Baum two‐piece cuff was used as the reference standard, to which a one‐piece Welch Allyn cuff was compared. In Phase 1 (two‐observer auscultation with a mercury sphygmomanometer), 88 subjects were required to obtain 255 paired BP determinations. In Phase 2 (oscillometric measurement with a Spacelabs 90207 device), 85 subjects were studied. Each study phase was analyzed separately using paired t‐tests. Results: For the auscultatory phase, mean age was 54.2+/‐20.5 years, mean arm circumference was 29.9+/‐3.7 cm, 60% were female and 32% had a past history of hypertension. Mean BP levels for the one‐piece cuff were lower than the two‐piece cuff (115.5+/‐15.5/66.4+/‐9.3 vs. 117.8+/‐15.2/67.9+/‐9.2; difference of‐2.4+/‐3.6/‐1.5+/‐2.4; p‐values<0.0001 for both comparisons). For the oscillometric phase, mean age was 52.8+/‐20.8 years, mean arm circumference was 29.4+/‐3.9 cm, 67% were female, and 38% had hypertension. Mean BPs were lower for the one‐piece compared to the two‐piece cuff (116.5+/‐12.8/67.1+/‐8.1 vs. 120.8+/‐13.5/70.4+/‐8.5; difference of‐4.4+/‐3.6/‐3.3+/‐2.7; p‐values<0.0001 for both). Conclusions: Mean BP is lower when one‐piece cuffs are used instead of two‐piece cuffs. Differences are greater with oscillometry. Therefore, when performing validation studies and measurements for clinical purposes, the potential effect of cuff type should be taken into account.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: ‐‐To assess the effects of physical exercise training on blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension. DESIGN: ‐‐Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: ‐‐Hospital‐based cardiac rehabilitation program. PATIENTS: ‐‐Ninety‐nine men and women with untreated mild hypertension (systolic blood pressure, 140 to 180 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure, 90 to 105 mm Hg) were included in the volunteer sample. INTERVENTIONS: ‐‐Subjects were randomly assigned to a 4‐month program of aerobic exercise training, strength and flexibility training, or to a waiting list control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ‐‐The main outcome measures were systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured four times with a random zero sphygmomanometer on 3 separate days in a clinic setting. RESULTS: ‐‐After 4 months of exercise training, subjects in the aerobic exercise group did not exhibit greater reductions in blood pressure than subjects in the control group. We expected a differential decline of 5 mm Hg between the aerobic exercise and waiting list control groups and found a difference of ‐1.0 +/‐ 16 mm Hg and ‐1.2 +/‐ 10 mm Hg at alpha = .05 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ‐‐Moderate aerobic exercise alone should not be considered a replacement for pharmacologic therapy in nonobese patients with mild hypertension.

AB  -  A random sample of ten community‐based Vita‐Stat automatic blood pressure recorders (ABPR) was evaluated for accuracy and repeatability. Each of 518 adult volunteers had two randomly ordered systolic and diastolic Vita‐Stat blood pressure measurements compared with two corresponding measurements obtained by a trained observer using a Random‐Zero sphygmomanometer. Eight of the ten Vita‐Stat recorders underestimated systolic blood pressure. In contrast, diastolic blood pressure was overestimated by nine of the ten machines. While the overall differences in average blood pressure were small (mean +/‐ SEM = ‐2.4 +/‐ 0.6 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and +2.3 +/‐ 0.4 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure), the magnitude of the average discrepancy varied considerably by machine (+4.7 to ‐13.8 mm Hg for systolic and +5.0 to ‐2.0 for diastolic blood pressure). At every level of systolic and diastolic blood pressure the Vita‐Stat ABPR provided a less accurate method of classifying blood pressure among individuals than the human observer. Additional analyses exploring the ability of the Vita‐Stat machine to measure an individual's blood pressure within 2, 4, or 6 mm Hg of the corresponding Random‐Zero value again suggested that the Vita‐Stat ABPR was less accurate than the human observer. Duplicate Vita‐Stat readings were less repeatable than corresponding Random‐Zero measurements. Based on the findings of this study, the Vita‐Stat ABPR appears to be an unsatisfactory tool for community‐based self‐measurement of blood pressure.

AB  -  To compare the effect of four drug groups on the ambulatory circadian blood pressure (BP) pattern, amiloride hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, nifedipine, and perindopril (5/50 mg/d, 100 mg/d, 40 mg/d, and 4 mg/d respectively, for 14 days) were alternated in each of 20 essential hypertension patients. Diuretics induced the largest (P < 0.05) drop in mean 24‐hour systolic BP (‐12 mmHg, P < 0.001). Atenolol reduced only its standard deviation, and nifedipine reduced only the mean daytime systolic BP (P < 0.05). The mean 24‐hour diastolic BP was equally reduced by all drugs except nifedipine, which only reduced (P < 0.05) the mean daytime value. The mean 24‐hour heart rate was decreased by atenolol (P < 0.001), increased by diuretics (P < 0.05), and unchanged with perindopril, while nifedipine increased (P < 0.05) only its night‐time value. In conclusion, diuretics were the strongest agents in reducing systolic BP, atenolol the only agent that reduced variability, perindopril the only agent that did not affect the heart rate, and nifedipine reduced only daytime BP values.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: Group A (experimental group): The participants received an integrative approach (AT without magnetic pellet pressing plus Western medication). The magnetic pellets used in this study contained an average of ~200 gauss/pellet magnetic flux densities, with a diameter of ~0.13 cm. No pellet pressing should take place. The total treatment period was 4 weeks. Group B (comparison group): The participants received an integrative approach (AT with magnetic pellet pressing, plus Western medication). Using the same kind of pellets as in Group A, the clients were additionally asked to press the pellets against the acupoints three times daily, with 1 minute for each point until a sensation of distension and warmth was felt. The clients were required to fill out a self‐reported therapy compliance daily record to allow the researcher to monitor the degree of compliance in pellet pressing. CONDITION: Uncontrolled mild hypertension ; Circulatory System ; Essential (primary) hypertension PRIMARY OUTCOME: Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) was used as the main outcome measure in this study owing to its clinical and physiological significance in both the representation of perfusion pressure and the effect on the calculation of hemodynamic variables. After a 10‐minute rest, the participants blood pressure readings were recorded using the Datascope Electronic Sphygmomanometer at baseline, at weekly visits to the clinic during the 4‐week treatment course, and at 1 month and 2 months following the whole course. Datascope is one of the valid blood pressure measuring devices recently recommended by the European Society of Hypertension for clinical use in hospitals. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Self reported by the participants at the end of the treatment course and included:; 1. Frequency of nocturnal polyuria; 2. Perceived sleep condition; 3. Calmness of mind; 4. Appetite INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Borderline‐controlled hypertension was defined in the present study as blood pressure (BP) remaining above 140/90 mmHg even when the patient was on anti‐hypertensive therapy in accordance with the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) guideline. 2.

AB  -  INTRODUCTION: The drug can be administered once a day, if the trough‐to‐peak ratio (T/P) exceeds 50‐66%. The objective of this work was to determine and compare the T/P ratio for betaxolol hydrochloride and for extended‐release metoprolol tartrate. METHODS: An open, randomized, prospective, comparative clinical study. The 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure was measured with a SpaceLab 90207 automatic instrument (Redmond, Washington, USA) before and after 3 months of beta‐blocker treatment. In order to determine the peak value, the individual maximum hourly mean blood pressure reduction was determined in the 3 to 6‐h post‐dose interval. For the determination of the trough value, the individual hourly mean blood pressure decrease in the 23‐h post‐dose interval, minimal 30 min after getting up in the morning was used. The T/P ratio was calculated as the mean of individual T/P ratios with statistical description of standard deviation (SD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Betaxolol hydrochloride reduced the mean peak systolic blood pressure value by 17.87+/‐8.32 mmHg, the mean peak diastolic blood pressure value by 16.07+/‐6.65 mmHg, the mean trough systolic blood pressure value by 11.83+/‐5.98 mmHg and the mean trough diastolic blood pressure value by 11.33+/‐6.74 mmHg. The mean T/P ratio was calculated as 72.84+/‐33.32% (95% CI, 60.40‐85.285%) for systolic blood pressure and as 71.57+/‐29.35% (95% CI, 60.62‐82.53%) for diastolic blood pressure. Metoprolol reduced the mean peak systolic blood pressure value by 16.70+/‐10.54 mmHg, the mean peak diastolic blood pressure value by 14.20+/‐8.67 mmHg, the mean trough systolic blood pressure value by 11.30+/‐9.12 mmHg and the mean trough diastolic blood pressure value by 10.00+/‐8.38 mmHg. The mean T/P ratio was calculated as 70.59+/‐31.66% (95% CI, 58.76‐82.41%) for systolic blood pressure and as 66.95+/‐31.60% (95% CI, 55.15‐78.75%) for diastolic blood pressure. CONCLUSION: The T/P ratio determined for betaxolol hydrochloride and extended‐release metoprolol tartrate is higher than 66%. This ratio guarantees a satisfactory 24‐h effect of both the above‐mentioned drugs.

AB  -  Patient selection and study preparations Potentially eligible hemodialysis patients, not fitting the exclusion criteria, will provide written informed consent and will be evaluated for the diagnosis of hypertension. If patients are treated with antihypertensive therapy, a brief‐wash out from medications period will take place and home BP will be monitored up to a maximum of 4 weeks. During this period BP ≥160/110 mmHg will be a threshold for further medication withdrawal. Hypertension diagnosis will be based on mean BP values ≥135/85 mmHg with home BP monitoring the days after the mid and last dialysis of the week for 2 consecutive weeks using a validated self‐inflating automatic oscillometric device (cuff with bladder size encircling at least 80% of arm circumference and covering two thirds of arm length). Every patient will be asked to conduct both morning and evening BP measurements at the level of brachial artery after 5 min of rest and with two measurements per occasion taken 2 min apart according to the European Society of Hypertension 2013 guidelines. The mean of the last measurements would be used. Study period A total number of 70 eligible patients undergoing hemodialysis in the Hemodialysis Unit of the Department of Nephrology, Hippokration Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece and in affiliated Hemodialysis Units in Northern Greece, as well in the Hemodialysis Units of the Department of Nephrology University Clinical Centre Maribor, Slovenia will participate in the study. In all potentially eligible patients full medical history, as well as demographic characteristics and drug treatment will be recorded, followed by a detailed physical examination. Patients that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be randomized with a ratio of 1:1 into two equal groups consisting of 35 patients. In the intervention group a specific treatment strategy for dry‐weight reduction will be applied guided by lung ultrasound, whereas in the control group standard‐of‐care treatment will be applied guided by conventional clinical criteria. Blood samples for hematological and biochemical laboratory tests will be collected at baseline prior to a mid‐week dialysis session; these tests will correspond to the routine monthly laboratory tests of the patients. In the intervention group UF regimen and dry‐weight will be guided by the number of pre‐dialysis US‐B lines measured by lung ultrasound prior to a mid‐week dialysis session. In patients who will be included in both the main study (LUST) and the present sub‐study (i.e. additional inclusion criteria of LUST study: history of myocardial infarction with or without ST elevation or unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome documented by ECG recordings and cardiac troponins or stable angina pectoris with documented coronary artery disease by prior coronary angiography or ECG or dyspnea class III‐IV NYHA), a total number of ≥15 US‐B lines indicates moderate to severe lung congestion; UF will be intensified in these patients. They will undergo dry‐weight reduction less than 0.2 kg/session (0.6 kg/week) with a maximum UF rate ≤10 ml/kg/h, so that episodes of hemodynamic instability and hypotension are minimized. If needed longer and/or additional dialysis sessions will be applied to a maximum of 5 hours/session or 4 sessions/week. US‐B lines measurements will be repeated at least once a week (before and after a mid‐week dialysis session) until the treatment goal is achieved (<15 US‐B lines) over a period of 8 weeks. Thereafter, lung ultrasound will be conducted once a month. In patients without pulmonary congestion at pre‐dialysis baseline (<15 US‐B lines), no UF intensification will be applied and US‐B lines will be measured on a weekly basis. Patients in the intervention group with <15 US‐B lines at baseline who will develop clinical signs of pulmonary congestion and/or ≥15 US‐B lines at any time will be treated according to those with lung congestion at baseline. In patients who will be included only in the present sub‐study, and are expected to have hypertension with better cardiac function and, possibly, less degree of lung congestion compared to the typical subjects of the main LUST study, UF will be intensified on the basis of a total number of ≥5 US‐B lines which indicates mild to moderate lung congestion. These patients will also undergo careful dry‐weight reduction less than 0.2 kg/session (0.6 kg/week) with a maximum UF rate ≤10 ml/kg/h, so that episodes of hemodynamic instability and hypotension are minimized. If needed longer and/or additional dialysis sessions will be applied to a maximum of 5 hours/session or 4 sessions/week. US‐B lines measurements will be repeated at least once a week (before and after a mid‐week dialysis session) until the treatment goal is achieved (<5 US‐B lines) over a period of 8 weeks. Thereafter, lung ultrasound will be conducted once a month. In patients without pulmonary congestion at pre‐dialysis baseline (<5 US‐B lines), no UF intensification will be applied and US‐B lines will be measured on a weekly basis. Patients in the intervention group with <5 US‐B lines at baseline who will develop clinical signs of pulmonary congestion and/or ≥5 US‐B lines at any time will be treated according to those with lung congestion at baseline. Reduction of post‐dialysis weight with UF intensification to achieve treatment goal will be pursued for 8 weeks. During this period BP should be maintained in levels <160/110 mmHg. If BP exceeds these levels, per protocol drug therapy will be initiated. As a first step, carvedilol per os will be administered on a starting dose of 3.125 mg b.i.d. up to a maximum tolerated dose (≤25 mg b.i.d.) until BP levels are <160/110 mmHg or until patient experiences signs of bradycardia (HR <60 bpm) or other adverse effects. As a second step of drug therapy, irbesartan will be initiated on a starting dose of 75 mg daily up to maximum tolerated dose (≤300 mg daily) until BP levels are <160/110 mmHg or any adverse effects are presented. Finally, amlodipine on a starting dose of 5 mg daily up to maximum tolerated dose (≤10 mg daily) will be administered on failure of the two previous steps to achieve BP levels <160/110 mmHg. If BP is still not controlled at goal, any antihypertensive class can be added according to treating physician's choice. In the control group follow‐up, dry‐weight and UF regimen will be guided only by conventional clinical and laboratory criteria. Blood pressure and blood pressure changes over time, pedal edema, presence or absence of dyspnea, body weight gain between dialysis and hemodynamic instability during dialysis session will be some of the clinical criteria that will determine possible post‐dialysis weight adjustments in these patients. The use of lung ultrasound to estimate lung congestion will not be allowed in these patients. A threshold of BP 160/110 mmHg will be set for the first 8 weeks of the study. If BP exceeds these levels, per protocol drug therapy will be initiated as mentioned in the intervention group. After 8 weeks of treatment, per protocol drug therapy will be performed in patients from both study groups, aiming at maintaining Home BP levels <135/85 mmHg. The primary and secondary measurements of the study will be carried in prespecified time‐points that are listed below: Study‐Point 1: Participants in the study will be asked to come to their dialysis unit 30 min before the start of the first or second dialysis of the week. A Mobil‐O‐Graph monitor with a cuff of appropriate size will be fitted to and BP will be recorded for 48 hours. The device will be programmed to collect data every 20 minutes, except for 23:00 to 07:00 (data collection every 30 minutes). An ABPM would be considered successful if >80% of recordings are valid with no more than two non‐consecutive day hours (07.00‐23.00 hours) with fewer than two valid measurements, and no more than one night hour (23.00‐07.00 hours without valid recording, according to standard recommendations for ABPM. Patients with unsuccessful 24‐hour ABPM will repeat the measurement a week later. Participants in the study will further come to the echocardiography unit on the first or the second interdialytic day of the week (Tuesday or Thursday for patients on M‐W‐F schedule and Wednesday or Friday for patients on T‐T‐S schedule) exactly 24 hours after the scheduled starting time of the previous dialysis session. All study participants will undergo an echocardiography study, as well as US‐B lines measurement with lung ultrasound. Body composition would be estimated with the use of Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. PWV and AIx recordings with the Sphygmocor device would be taken. The results from this echocardiographic study and 48‐hour ABPM will be used as the baseline reference.. Following echocardiographic assessment, patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio in the intervention and control arms with permuted blocks of 4 subjects, using a computer‐generated randomization schedule stratified by sex and center. Participants in the study will be asked to come to their dialysis unit one hour earlier than their second (Wednesday or Thursday) or the third (Friday or Saturday) dialysis session of the week is scheduled, following at least a 8‐hour fast and without having received their morning medication. The ABPM device will be removed and checked for completeness. Patients with unsuccessful 48‐hour ABPM will repeat the measurement and all further evaluations a week later. Body weight will be measured with the use of validated electronic weighting scales. Height will be also evaluated for the BMI calculation. Office blood pressure measurements will be acquired after 5 min of rest (sitting posture) with the use of a validated oscillometric device or standard mercury sphygmomanometer at the level of brachial artery in the contralateral arm of the side where vascular access is located. Venous blood specimens will be collected for routine hematological and biochemical laboratory testing, as mentioned before. A lung ultrasound will be conducted in all study participants in the intervention group using the GE VScan lung ultrasound device, 15 minutes before hemodialysis session initiation. With patient in a lying posture pre‐dialysis US‐B lines will be measured in both lungs, while the transducer is placed vertically from the second up to the fifth intercostal space consecutively, along the parasternal, the mid‐clavear, the anterior axillary and the mid axillary lines. All measurements will be performed in a quiet room with controlled air temperature (approximately 22 ° C) The sum of the US‐B lines produces a score (US‐B lines score) and UF regimen will be guided accordingly. In patients who will be include in both the main LUST study and the present sub‐study with ≥15 US‐B lines and in patients who will be included only in this sub‐study with ≥5 US‐B lines, UF will be intensified and dry‐weight will be reduced according to the value of US‐B lines score over a period of 8 weeks (Figure 2). Thresholds in dry‐weight reduction and UF rates will be applied and if needed longer and/or additional dialysis sessions will be conducted as mentioned before. In the control arm standard‐of‐care treatment will be applied guided by conventional clinical criteria. Afterwards all study participants from both arms will undergo their scheduled dialysis session. Over the period of the first 8 weeks of the study US‐B lines measurements with lung ultrasound will be repeated at least once a week (before and after a mid‐week dialysis session) in all patients in the active arm. During this period per protocol drug therapy will be initiated if BP exceeds a threshold of home BP 160/110 mmHg. Study Point 2: Two months (8 weeks) after baseline all patients will be subjected again in the examinations described at Study Point 1 (i.e. 48‐hour ABPM, echocardiography, bioimpedance analysis and pulse wave tonometry) exactly in the same manner with regards to the scheduled hemodialysis sessions. If treatment goal is achieved during this post‐dialysis US‐B lines measurement, lung ultrasounds will be conducted once a month from this point on. Patients in the intervention group who have achieved the treatment goal of post‐dialysis US‐B lines score at previous evaluations and who will develop clinical signs of pulmonary congestion and/or ≥15 or ≥5 US‐B lines according to the patients' stratification at any time will be treated according to those with lung congestion at baseline. A threshold of Home BP <135/85 mmHg will be set after this point and when needed the same per protocol drug therapy will be performed in patients from both study groups. Study Point 3: One year after their first evaluation all patients will undergo all examinations described in baseline, with a similar order.

AB  -  Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may affect blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients receiving drug treatment, but data on the effects of low‐dose aspirin are scanty. This study assessed the effects of chronic treatment with low doses of aspirin (100 mg/day) on clinic and ‐ ambulatory systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP in hypertensives on chronic, stable antihypertensive therapy. The study was conducted in the framework of the Primary Prevention Project (PPP), a randomized, controlled factorial trial on the preventive effect of aspirin or vitamin E in people with one or more cardiovascular risk factors. Fifteen Italian hypertension units studied 142 hypertensive patients (76 men, 66 women; mean age 59 + 5.9 years) treated with different antihypertensive drugs: 71 patients were randomized to aspirin and 71 served as controls. All patients underwent a clinic BP evaluation with an automatic sphygmomanometer and a 24‐h ambulatory BP monitoring, at baseline and after 3 months of aspirin treatment. At the end of the study the changes in clinic SBP and DBP were not statistically different in treated and untreated subjects. Ambulatory SBP and DBP after 3 months of aspirin treatment were similar to baseline: SBP ‐0.5 mmHg (95% confidence intervals [CI] from ‐1.9 to +2.9 mm Hg) and DBP ‐1.1 mm Hg (95% CI from ‐2.5 to +0.3 mm Hg). The pattern was similar in the control group. No interaction was found between aspirin and the most used antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists). Despite the relatively small sample size our results seem to exclude any significant influence of low‐dose aspirin on BP control in hypertensives under treatment.

AB  -  24 hour blood pressure monitoring is a well established method in the field of antihypertensive research. Patients self recorded blood pressure values are an additional option to overcome the disadvantages of casual office readings‐‐however they are not frequently used within intervention trials. To prove the usefulness of selfrecordings in clinical trials we investigated both selfrecordings taken twice a day and casual readings within intervals of 1 to 3 weeks, in this study on the efficacy and tolerability of the ACE‐inhibitor Accupro. 108 hypertensive patients (grade WHO I to II) were included in this trial for ten weeks. Although blood pressures were measured by the patients using sphygmomanometers of the same type and the physicians, decisions to treat or to increase dosage were based on the patients' recordings only. Accupro was dispensed according to the package leaflet at a daily dosage of 5 mg up to 40 mg. In case of failing response to monotherapy, Accupro was combined with Diltiazem or with a diuretic. 7 patients discontinued the treatment due to mild adverse events, one did not cooperate. 82 of the remaining patients were treated effectively with Accupro monotherapy‐‐60 (73%) got one dose daily, 22 (27%) 2 doses per day,‐‐and in 18 patients a drug combination was required. Therapeutic response (RRd < or = 90 mm Hg) was gained within 86 of the 100 evaluable patients according to the doctors' and 83 according to the patients' records. In this respect the two methods used gave comparable overall results. This somewhat surprising fact is due to the design of the study, because treatment decisions were based on the selfrecordings only. Clinical trials based on selfrecordings are in some points preferable to casual office readings: As patients being normotensive at home should not be included into an interventional study, a change of dosage within this group is avoided. Additionally the compliance of a cooperative patient taking his blood pressure twice daily is at a high level. Measurements of each single patient may be evaluated statistically by time series‐analysis regarding longterm distribution of blood pressure‐values. Taking the means of selfrecordings over adequate time‐intervals eliminates the influence of "outliers" (occasionally extremely high or low values) and also reduces the standard deviation compared to that of the casual readings. Research work based on self recordings provides more information and therefore more security for treatment decisions.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Auscultatory measurement of office blood pressure (BP) by mercury sphygmomanometers (AuscBPM) is still the gold standard in clinical trials and registration studies for antihypertensive drugs. The increasing availability of accurate automated oscillometric BP measuring devices has offered new perspectives in this field, although their usefulness in drug studies has not been systematically tested yet. METHODS: During the course of Valsartan 320 mg EU Registration Study we used an electronic automated oscillometric BP measuring device (eBPM) as an alternative to conventional AuscBPM. Altogether 3776 patients were randomized into a double‐blinded actively controlled parallel group study in 303 centers, and 54 422 BP readings were recorded by the validated, electronic, automated oscillometric device OMRON 705IT with digital printouts. Terminal digit preference and preference at therapeutic cutoff points were evaluated. The data were compared with the results of an earlier valsartan study similar in design but based on conventional AuscBPM. Furthermore, based on a simulation, four strategies for automated BP measurement with varying number of office readings (3‐5) were analyzed to define an optimal method to collect BP at office visits. RESULTS: eBPM eliminated terminal digit preference and dramatically reduced preferences for therapeutic cutoff points as compared with earlier valsartan trials with conventional AuscBPM. However, even with eBPM a minor bias with the therapeutic cutoff value was observed probably because of an observer bias during data documentation. The within‐patient variability of three measurements sequentially taken at each visit was similar to other strategies including more measurements. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our data, we suggest that eBPM is a suitable alternative to AuscBPM in clinical trials and registration studies, and may carry specific advantages. Automatic data transfer of recorded values to electronic patient files may further minimize observer bias. Manufacturers should consider such findings for the development of professional devices.

AB  -  We evaluated use of a program to improve blood pressure measurement at 6 primary care clinics over a 6‐month period. The program consisted of automated devices, clinical training, and support for systems change. Unannounced audits and electronic medical records provided evaluation data. Clinics used devices in 81.0% of encounters and used them as intended in 71.6% of encounters, but implementation fidelity varied. Intervention site systolic and diastolic blood pressure with terminal digit "0" decreased from 32.1% and 33.7% to 11.1% and 11.3%, respectively. Improvement occurred uniformly, regardless of sites' adherence to the measurement protocol. Providers rechecked blood pressure measurements less often post‐intervention (from 23.5% to 8.1% of visits overall). Providers at sites with high protocol adherence were less likely to recheck measurements than those at low adherence sites. Comparison sites exhibited no change in terminal digit preference or repeat measurements. This study demonstrates that clinics can apply a pragmatic intervention to improve blood pressure measurement. Additional refinement may improve implementation fidelity.

AB  -  Introduction: Hypertension is one of the major public health challenges worldwide. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are among the first line antihypertensive drugs. However, optimal treatment strategies in mild to moderate hypertensives who failed to achieve blood pressure (BP) control with low‐dose mono‐therapy are not well established. This study was done to compare efficacy and safety of high dose mono‐therapy of Amlodipine, Telmisartan and their low dose combination in mild to moderate hypertensives who failed to achieve BP control with low dose mono‐therapy of either drug. Materials and Methods: A total of 96 patients, fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent. Patients were randomized into three treatment groups i.e. Telmisartan 80 mg, Amlodipine 10 mg and low dose combination of Telmisartan 40 mg +Amlodipine 5 mg once daily for two months. The systolic BP, Diastolic BP, and ADRs were recorded at 0, 2, 4, 8 weeks. Results: In the present study, significant reduction of mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was seen in all the three treatment groups. Low dose combination of Amlodipine 5 mg and Telmisartan 40 mg showed statistically significant reduction in SBP as compared to Telmisartan 80 mg mono‐therapy and in DBP as compared to Amlodipine 10 mg mono‐therapy. Maximum adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in Amlodipine mono‐therapy group, like ankle oedema, constipation, headache and fatigue. Discussion and Conclusion: In term of BP control, low‐dose combination therapy appears a better therapeutic approach than high‐dose mono‐therapy.

AB  -  Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the hemodynamic and metabolic actions of estrogen plus progestin therapy (EPT) in hypertensive, postmenopausal women treated with perindopril (ACEI) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). A group of normotensive postmenopausal women was also studied. Methods: 100 hypertensive and 40 normotensive postmenopausal women were recruited for the study. The hypertensive females were randomly assigned to receive ACEI or HCTZ for 12 months. The patients of the ACEI group and the patients of the HCTZ group, as well as normotensives, were further subdivided into two subgroups each. One subgroup received estrogen plus progestin therapy (EPT+), the other subgroup received no hormone replacement (EPT−). Combined hormone replacement with transdermal patches releasing 17β‐estradiol and norethisterone was used. Office and 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured at baseline and during follow‐up. Renal plasma flow (RPF) was measured using the clearance of [125I]‐iodohippuran. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was determined with an automatic device. Results: In normotensive postmenopausal women, transdermal estrogen plus progestin therapy increases RPF and insulin sensitivity, decreases PWV, decreases total and LDL cholesterol, and decreases uric acid serum levels. Perindopril (4 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day) were equally effective in reducing blood pressure in postmenopausal, hypertensive subjects. In these females, perindopril increased RPF and decreased PWV and plasma insulin levels. These effects of the ACEI were not altered by estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide decreased RPF and increased plasma insulin and uric acid concentrations in hypertensive subjects whom were not receiving estrogen plus progestin therapy. Conclusions: The unfavorable metabolic and hemodynamic actions of the diuretic were counteracted by estrogen plus progestin therapy. Concomitant estrogen plus progestin therapy may be a method to avoid unfavorable hemodynamic and metabolic effects of thiazide diuretics in hypertensive, postmenopausal women.

AB  -  Background: Hypertension affects 30% of adults worldwide. Garlic supplements have shown promise in the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension, and the mechanism of action is biologically plausible. Our trial is the first to assess the effect of aged garlic extract on central blood pressure and arterial stiffness, regarded as important risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity. Subjects and methods: A total of 88 general practice patients and community members with uncontrolled hypertension completed a double‐blind randomized placebo‐controlled trial of 12 weeks investigating the effect of daily intake of aged garlic extract (1.2 g containing 1.2 mg S‐allylcysteine) or placebo on blood pressure, and secondary outcome measures of central‐hemodynamics and other cardiovascular markers, including cholesterol, homocysteine, platelet function, and inflammatory markers. Results: Mean blood pressure was significantly reduced by 5.0±2.1 mmHg (P=0.016) systolic, and in responders by 11.5±1.9 mmHg systolic and 6.3±1.1 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo (P,0.001). Central hemodynamic‐measures tended to improve in the garlic group more than in the placebo group, including central blood pressure, central pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, augmentation pressure, pulse‐wave velocity, and arterial stiffness. While changes in other cardiovascular markers did not reach significance due to small numbers in subgroups with elevated levels, trends in beneficial effects of garlic on the inflammatory markers TNFα, total cholesterol, low‐density lipid cholesterol, and apolipoproteins were observed. Aged garlic extract was highly tolerable and acceptable, and did not increase the risk of bleeding in patients on blood‐thinning medication. Conclusion: Our trial suggests that aged garlic extract is effective in reducing peripheral and central blood pressure in a large proportion of patients with uncontrolled hypertension, and has the potential to improve arterial stiffness, inflammation, and other cardiovascular markers in patients with elevated levels. Aged garlic extract was highly tolerable with a high safety profile as a stand‐alone or adjunctive antihypertensive treatment.

AB  -  STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of amlodipine and valsartan in African‐American patients with hypertension using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double‐blind, crossover comparison study. SETTING: University‐affiliated cardiac center clinic. PATIENTS: Twenty African‐Americans (12 men, 8 women), with a history of uncomplicated hypertension (blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive amlodipine 5 or 10 mg/day or valsartan 80 or 160 mg/day for 8‐10 weeks, depending on response. Dosages were titrated to achieve a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or below. For patients whose blood pressures were not controlled, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day was added to their regimens. Patients then underwent 24‐hour ABPM. After an intervening washout period during which baseline blood pressure was reestablished, patients received the other treatment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean +/‐ SD baseline blood pressure before the two ABPM periods were 155 +/‐ 12/100 +/‐ 8 mm Hg and 156 +/‐ 11/101 +/‐ 9 mm Hg, respectively. Fifteen (75%) patients achieved goal blood pressure with amlodipine and 14 (70%) with valsartan (p=0.62). Final daily dosages were as follows: amlodipine 5 mg in nine patients, 10 mg in five patients, and 10 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide in six patients; valsartan 80 mg in nine patients, 160 mg in four patients, and 160 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide in seven patients. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was not completed in three patients due to adverse effects: headache and dizziness (one patient each, amlodipine and valsartan) and hyperkalemia (one patient, valsartan). Four patients (20%) in each treatment group had drug‐related adverse effects. Results of ABPM including averages for 24‐hour, daytime, nighttime, first 4 hours, and last 8 hours, and trough:peak ratios were not significantly different between the amlodipine‐ and valsartan‐based treatments. CONCLUSION: Based on both clinic blood pressure measurements and ABPM data, amlodipine and valsartan produced similar reductions in blood pressure in African‐American patients with uncomplicated hypertension.

AB  -  The main purpose of this study is to estimate the influence of taking a number of placebo tablets to obtain hypotensive effects and some psychological parameters with essential hypertension. 197 patients (102F/95M) aged between 18‐80 years (average age 52,3) with essential hypertension were included in the research in two outpatients clinics. The patients who participated in research, stayed for at least seven days without any pharmacological treatment. They had a diastolic pressure (DBP) between 95 ‐ 114 mm Hg and systolic pressure (SBP) up to 200 mm Hg. 92 patients had taken one tablet a day and 105 patients had taken two tablets in the morning. This was before the placebo was included and two weeks after their blood pressure had been taken by standard methods (sphygmomanometer). They were monitored daily throughout the period using traditional methods and ABPM (SpaceLabs 90121). The patients completed two psychological tests. 97 records (52F/45M) qualified for statistical analysis (80% of measurements were undertaken properly, and the time between measurements was less than two hours). Psychological questionnaires were correctly completed by 92 patients. The visible results of decreasing systolic and diastolic value of blood pressure were obtained after using one (group 1) and two (group 2) placebo tablets. They were monitored by a standard method and recorded by ABPM. In group 1 SBP decreased from 164 + 11.4 mm Hg to 158 + 8.8 mm Hg (p < 0.01, on standard method) and from 149.5 + 17.8 to 144.5 + 8.3 mm Hg daily (p < 0.05, ABPM). DBP in this examined group decreased from 106.2 + + 2.8 to 102 + 3.9 mm Hg (p < 0.01, stand. method), and from 103.2 + 2,6 to 98.6 + 1.2 mm Hg daily (p < 0.05, ABPM). In the second group SBP decreased from 169 + 12.8 to 157.6 + 17.9 mm Hg (p < 0.001, stand. method), and in ABPM from 148.5 + 15.8 to 139.6 + 16.2 mm Hg (p < 0.01). In this same group, DBP decreased from 104.4 + 2.6 to 98 + + 3.4 mm hG (p < 0.001, stand. method), and from 107.4 + 5.8 mm Hg to 95.5 + 4.2 mm Hg‐daily (p < 0.001, ABPM). There were no differences between heart rate in all groups of patients. In both groups there were significant statistical differences in negative symptoms, physical symptoms and anexity, but a more optimistic mood was observed by group 2. More effective hypertensive treatment was observed within the group which was treated with two placebo tablets. This group was characterized by more optimistic mood compared to the group which was treated with one placebo tablet a day.

AB  -  The SpaceLabs Medical oscillometric blood pressure monitor was evaluated in both neonatal and adult populations according to the 1992 AAMI SP‐10 standard for electronic or automated sphygmomanometers. For the neonatal study, the umbilical artery pressure was used as a reference. Fifteen newborn ICU patients were enrolled in the study, yielding a total of 150 pairs of comparison readings. For the adult study, the first and fifth phases of the Korotkoff sounds were used as a reference. One hundred twelve adults were enrolled in the study, yielding a total of 336 pairs of comparison readings. Accuracy was analyzed by the AAMI SP‐10 standard. For systolic and diastolic pressures, respectively, the mean differences +/‐ standard deviations of oscillometric accuracy were 0.1 +/‐ 4.3 and 2.7 +/‐ 4.8 mmHg for the neonatal study and ‐0.6 +/‐ 5.9 and 0.9 +/‐ 6.4 mmHg for the adult study, which are within the AAMI SP‐10 accuracy standard. Reproducibility was analyzed by a new approach developed from the sequential technique of the 1990 British Hypertension Society protocol. For systolic and diastolic pressures, respectively, the mean differences +/‐ standard deviations of the oscillometric reproducibility were estimated to be ‐0.1 +/‐ 3.3 and 0.1 +/‐ 3.4 mmHg for the neonatal study and ‐0.3 +/‐ 3.2 and 0.1 +/‐ 3.5 mmHg for the adult study.

AB  -  Hypertension affects 1 billion people worldwide and is a primary public health concern as the leading cause of premature mortality. A common polymorphism, the C677 T mutation in the gene, MTHFR, encoding the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) affects 12% of the UK and Irish population and is associated with an increased risk of hypertension(1). The activity of MTHFR, which generates the predominant co‐factor form of folate, 5 methyl‐tetrahydrofolate, is dependent on flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), the co‐enzyme form of riboflavin. Individuals homozygous for the MTHFR 677TT genotype have reduced MTHFR enzyme activity resulting in lower 5 methyl‐THF concentrations(2), however previous randomised controlled trials at our Centre have shown that blood pressure (BP) is highly responsive to riboflavin supplementation specifically in individuals with the TT genotype(3). The mechanism explaining how this gene‐nutrient interaction influences BP is unknown, but it may involve a nitric oxide (NO)‐mediated effect on endothelial function(1). The aim of this study was to investigate BP and endothelial function in adults stratified by MTHFR genotype. Healthy individuals, aged 18‐60 years, were recruited from workplaces across Northern Ireland and screened for MTHFR genotype. Participants were invited to an appointment where health and lifestyle information, anthropometry, BP and endothelial function were assessed and a blood sample was taken. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx), which are indices of endothelial function, were measured with a SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical, Australia). BP, PWV and AIx were compared across the MTHFR genotypes. Preliminary results in a subset of the study cohort, summarised in the table above, show that systolic BP is markedly higher in participants with the TT genotype, compared to CC and CT genotypes, with a similar, albeit non‐significant, trend for diastolic BP. Pulse wave velocity was significantly higher in individuals with the TT compared to CC genotype, indicating poorer endothelial compliance in this genetically at‐risk group. In conclusion, this study has shown for the first time that individuals with the MTHFR TT genotype have poorer endothelial function compared to their age‐matched CC genotype counterparts. Further research investigating the effect of riboflavin (and folate) status on measures of vascular function is required, in order to further our understanding of the mechanism explaining this novel gene‐nutrient interaction in BP.

AB  -  Objective: The present study was planned to focus on comparative effects of telmisartan vs lisinopril on blood pressure in patients of metabolic syndrome Methods: The study was carried out on 62 patients of metabolic syndrome from Dec 2010 to Oct 2012 in OPD of Institute. There were two groups, A and B. Group A‐ Telmisartan (31 patients) and Group B‐ Lisinopril (31 patients) receiving Telmisartan 40 mg and lisinopril 5 mg orally once a day respectively for 12 weeks. The diagnosis of essential hypertension was made by the physician based on two measurements of blood pressure on two different occasions using auscultatory method and was done at initial stage and repeated after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment in Group A and Group B patients. Key findings: Our study found that telmisartan or lisinopril treatment for 12 weeks leads to statistically significant (p<0.001) reduction in both SBP and DBP at 6 and 12 weeks when compared with baseline, whereas comparison between telmisartan and lisinopril treatment failed to show any statistically significant effect. Conclusion: Treatment of metabolic patients with telmisartan or lisinopril for the management of hypertension reduced both Systolic blood pressure (SBP) as well as Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) statistically significantly during 12 weeks treatment. However, telmisartan and lisinopril treatment were found effective.

AB  -  Recent evidence suggests that bioactive compounds isolated from cereals and legumes could exert some metabolic and vascular effects in humans. Due to the recent identification of a non‐specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP2) in wheat with antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory activity, we aimed to comparatively test the hemodynamic and metabolic effects of ancient wheat foodstuffs (made of organic KAMUT® khorasan wheat) or modern wheat ones, made of a mixture of organic modern commercial durum (T. durum) varieties and soft wheat (T. aestivum), with different nsLTP2 content. Thus, we carried out a randomized, cross‐over clinical trial on 63 non‐diabetic healthy volunteers (aged 40⁻70 years) with systolic blood pressure (SBP) 130⁻139 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 85⁻90 mmHg (pre‐hypertensive/borderline high pressure subjects). Each treatment period lasted four weeks. After ancient wheat foodstuffs intake, subjects experienced a significant improvement in triglycerides (‐9.8% vs. baseline and ‐14.5% versus modern wheat), fasting plasma glucose (‐4.3% versus baseline and ‐31.6% versus modern wheat), diurnal SBP (‐3.1% vs. baseline and ⁻30.2% vs. modern wheat) and nocturnal SBP (‐3.2% vs. baseline and ‐36.8% vs. modern wheat), and pulse volume change (+4.2% vs. baseline and +2.3% vs. modern wheat) (p < 0.05 vs. baseline and versus modern wheat foodstuffs intake). Therefore, our findings show that substituting modern wheat products in diet with ancient wheat ones, might exert a mild improvement in 24‐h SBP and endothelial reactivity in pre‐hypertensive healthy subjects.

AB  -  In the first of two studies, 42 unmedicated mild hypertensives completed either 16 sessions of thermal biofeedback (TBF) training for hand (7 sessions) and foot (9 sessions) warming or 8 weeks of monitoring BPs at home. There was a trend (p < .10) for more of those treated (57.1%) to have DBPs lower than 90 mm Hg than for those only monitoring BPs at home (33%). Analyses of clinic BP values from random zero sphygmomanometer measurements, from 24‐hour ambulatory BP monitoring, and from home BP measurements made by the patient showed no advantage for treatment versus BP monitoring. Sixteen of the 21 patients in BP monitoring were later treated. Analyses of treatment effects across all treated subjects by gender revealed a significant (p = .02) decrease in DBP for treated female subjects (n = 13) but not for males (n = 24). In the second study the 22 initial treatment successes, that is, those whose DBP was below 90 mm Hg at posttreatment (59.4% of those who completed treatment), were randomized to an intensive follow‐up (monthly visits for 6 months, then visits every two months) emphasizing regular home practice with an electronic TBF device or regular follow‐up (visits every 3 months). Twelve of the 22 were still normotensive at 12 months. There were no differences at any point during the follow‐up between the two conditions in success rate or BPs despite a numerical advantage in reported frequency of home practice by those in the intensive follow‐up condition.

AB  -  Introduction and purpose: Arterial stiffness and aortic blood pressure (BP) augmentation are significantly increased in hemodialysis patients. Recent studies suggest that the prognostic significance of ambulatory recordings of arterial stiffness is high in hemodialysis. This study examines for the first time the effect of dry weight reduction with a standardized lungultrasound‐guided strategy on ambulatory aortic BP and arterial stiffness parameters in hypertensive hemodialysis patients. Methods: A total 71 hemodialysis patients with hypertension (mean home BP â‰¥135/85 mmHg), that were clinically euvolemic, were included in this single‐blind randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio in the active group (n=35), following a strategy for dry‐weight reduction guided by the total number of US‐B lines (US‐B lines score) prior to a mid‐week dialysis session and the control group (n=), following standardof‐care treatment. All patients underwent 48‐hour ABPM with the Mobil‐O‐Graph monitor (IEM, Stolberg, Germany) and PWV measurement in office with SphygmoCor (ArtCor, Sydney, Australia) at baseline and after 8‐weeks. Results: Overall, the US‐B lines change during follow‐up were ‐5.3Â±12.5 in active versus +2.2Â±7.6 in control group (p<0.001), which corresponded to dry‐weight changes of ‐0.71Â±1.39 versus +0.51Â±0.98 kg (p<0.001). The change in 48‐hour cSBP was significantly greater in the active group (‐6.30Â±8.90 vs ‐0.50Â±12.46, p=0.027); the relevant cDBP fall was marginally greater (‐3.85Â±6.61 vs ‐0.63Â±8.36, p=0.077) in the active group. 48‐hour cPP (41.51Â±9.63 vs 39.06Â±9.61 mmHg, p=0.004) and 48‐hour PWV (9.30Â±2.00 vs 9.08Â±2.04 m/sec, p=0.032) were significantly reduced from baseline to study‐end in the active group but remained unchanged in controls. In contrast, 48‐hour AIx and AIx(75) did not change between baseline and study‐end in both groups; changes in AIx(75) were similar in the two groups (‐0.97Â±3.51 vs ‐0.36Â±4.25, p=0.517). PWV measured in office was decreased from baseline to study‐end in the active (10.07Â±2.66 vs 9.79Â±2.81, p=0.038) but not in the control group. Conclusions: A lung‐ultrasound‐guided strategy for dry‐weight reduction reduces ambulatory aortic BP and ambulatory or office PWV, but not ambulatory AIx(75). These results suggest that dry‐weight reduction can primarily reduce aortic BP levels and large arteries stiffness but not wave reflections from the periphery.

AB  -  We tested the performance of the LAM 100 (also known as the Marshall F‐88), a semiautomated oscillometric device for discontinuous BP measurement at the finger, which could be very suitable for self‐recording of BP because of its small size and convenient mode of operation. The LAM 100 was compared with the random zero sphygmomanometer and with BP measured by the Finapres for beat‐to‐beat measurement of finger arterial pressure in 40 patients following guidelines of the AAMI. Compared with the random zero sphygmomanometer the LAM 100 underestimated SBP by 9 mmHg (SD 12) and DBP by 7 mmHg (SD 9). These differences exceed the limits set by the AAMI. The differences between the LAM 100 and the random zero spghymomanometer could not be explained by physiological peripheral pulse wave changes because Finapres SBP was underestimated by 4 mmHg (SD 15) and DBP was overestimated by the LAM 100 by 8 mmHg (SD 10). We conclude that the LAM 100 is not suitable for the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

AB  -  Forty hypertensive patients (diastolic greater than 95 mmHg) were included after 15 days of a single blind placebo period in a randomized placebo controlled double‐blind study to assess the antihypertensive effect of a new galenic form of nicardipine (N) administered 50 mg b.i.d. for 3 weeks. They comprised 27 men and 13 women aged from 27 to 72 years (mean: 53 +/‐ 10). Blood pressure (BP) was measured in hospital before morning drug intake by an automatic recorder (Sentron) in supine position for 30 minutes (min) and by a mercury sphygmomanometer. Ambulatory BP was assessed by a portable patient activated recorder (Remler 2000). Mercury sphygmomanometer supine BP under N fell from 160 +/‐ 21/104 +/‐ 6 mmHg to 151 +/‐ 14/98 +/‐ 8 mmHg (n = 20; p less than 0.01/p less than 0.01) whereas BP under placebo (P) was respectively 158 +/‐ 14/103 +/‐ 6 mmHg and 156 +/‐ 20/102 +/‐ 9 mmHg (NS). Sentron BP under N fell from 158 +/‐ 17/96 +/‐ 8 mmHg to 148 +/‐ 13/90 +/‐ 7 mmHg (p less than 0.001/p less than 0.01) with no BP change under P (152 +/‐ 12/93 +/‐ 7 mmHg to 151 +/‐ 14/93 +/‐ 8 mmHg NS). BP recorder every 30 min for 12 hours revealed a decrease under N (160 +/‐ 18/105 +/‐ 10 mmHg to 142 +/‐ 16/94 +/‐ 10 mmHg; p less than 0.001/p less than 0.001) with a placebo effect in the control group on the diastolic BP (160 +/‐ 15/103 +/‐ 7 mmHg to 156 +/‐ 16/100 +/‐ 8 mmHg/NS/p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  -  Background: Although recent hypertension guidelines recommend home blood pressure (HBP) monitoring, its effect in clinical practice is not well known. This study aimed to identify current HBP measurement status and obstacles and their efficacy on blood pressure (BP) control. Methods: Sixty‐three intervention and 61 control centers with 2483 (mean age: 58.0 years, 56.0% male) drug‐naïve stage 2 hypertensive patients or patients requiring second anti‐hypertensive medications were included. The intervention group was instructed to measure HBP twice a day for 7 days from the scheduled visit at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results: At the end of 12 weeks, 842 (68.7%) and 807 (64.15%) patients of the control and intervention groups, respectively, achieved a target BP. The odds ratio (OR) for improving BP control of HBP was 0.836 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.694–1.007). Among intervention group, clinic BP of the subgroup those measured their HBP at least once well controlled compared to subgroup those not measured their HBP at all (OR 1.602, 95% CI: 1.182–2.172). Only 19.17% (n = 476) had a home sphygmomanometer, and among those, 26.89% measured their BP at least once a week and 34.87% did not measure the BP at all. The obstacles of HBP measurement were lack of awareness of its importance (40.83%), lack of confidence on how to measure BP and maintain the measurement (37.04%), and difficulty in selecting an appropriate device (14.41%). Conclusions: HBP measurement alone did not improve BP control, but better compliance with the HBP measurement resulted in improved BP control. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials, NCT03254914, Registered 21 August 2017.

AB  -  There is evidence implicating abnormalities in the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in the development of glucocorticoid‐induced hypertension (GC‐HT). In humans, a reduction in NO availability during cortisol treatment has been observed. This study examined whether the NO donation may reverse the elevated blood pressure (BP) observed with cortisol treatment. A randomised double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover study was undertaken in eight healthy men to address the effect of co‐administration of isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN, 60 mg single dose, day 5) with cortisol (200 mg per day, days 1‐6) and then compared with placebo (single dose, day 5) with cortisol. After a 2‐week washout period, subjects crossed over to the alternate treatment. BP measurements were obtained using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Tonometry was used to estimate central pressures. There was a significant rise in mean arterial pressure with cortisol: 80 ± 3 vs 89 ± 3 mm Hg (day 1 vs day 5, cortisol+ISMN phase, P < 0.001) and 81 ± 3 vs 89 ± 3 mm Hg (day 1 vs day 5, cortisol+placebo phase, P < 0.01). ISMN significantly decreased aortic augmentation index: ‐17.3 ± 3.2 vs 1.8 ± 3.5%, (differences calculated from day 5‐day 1, cortisol/ISMN vs cortisol+placebo, P < 0.001). These results demonstrated that GC‐HT can be modified by co‐administration of exogenous NO donors, consistent with the hypothesis that GC‐HT is accompanied by reduced NO activity in humans.

AB  -  Recent studies showed that in diabetic hypertensive patients, administration of angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE)‐inhibitors or calcium antagonists can effectively lower blood pressure (BP) and prevent diabetes‐related cardiovascular complications with no adverse metabolic effects. We sought to assess the antihypertensive and metabolic effects of the new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist manidipine (M) in patients with diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension as compared with the ACE inhibitor enalapril (E). After 3 weeks of placebo, 101 (62 men; age range, 34‐72 years) hypertensives with type II diabetes mellitus were randomized to M 10‐20 mg or E 10‐20 mg, od, for 24 weeks. At the end of the placebo period and the active‐treatment phase, BP was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer (office, O) and over the 24 h by ambulatory (A) monitoring. ABP recordings were analyzed to obtain 24‐h, day (6 a.m. to midnight), and night (midnight to 6 a.m.) average systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP and heart rate (HR) values. Homogeneity of the antihypertensive effect over the 24 h was assessed by the smoothness index [SI: i.e., the ratio between the average of the 24 hourly BP changes after treatment and the corresponding standard deviation (the higher the SI, the more uniform is the BP control by treatment over the 24 h]. The O SBP and DBP were significantly (p < 0.01) and similarly reduced by M (16 +/‐ 10 and 13 +/‐ 6 mm Hg, n = 49) and E (15 +/‐ 10 and 13 +/‐ 6 mm Hg, n = 45). The percentage of patients whose O DBP was reduced < or = 85 mm Hg (i.e., the value indicated to be the optimal DBP goal in diabetic hypertensives) was similar for M (37%) and E (40%). The reduction of 24‐h BP also was similar between M (n = 38) and E (n = 38) for both drugs (systolic, 6 +/‐ 11 and 8 +/‐ 10 mm Hg; diastolic, 5 +/‐ 8 and 5 +/‐ 7; NS, M vs. E). The antihypertensive effect was distributed in a similar homogeneous fashion throughout the dosing interval, as shown by the similar SI values (M, 0.6 +/‐ 1.2 for SBP and 0.6 +/‐ 0.9 for DBP; E, 0.6 +/‐ 0.8 for SBP and 0.5 +/‐ 0.7 for DBP; NS, M vs. E). O and A HR were unchanged by either treatment. Markers of glucose and lipid metabolism and renal function were not significantly modified by treatment both with M and with E. In the diabetic hypertensives, M was as effective and metabolically neutral as the ACE‐inhibitor E.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Hypertension has proven to be a strong liability with 13.5% of all mortality worldwide being attributed to elevated blood pressures in 2001. An accurate blood pressure measurement lies at the crux of an appropriate diagnosis. Despite the mercury sphygmomanometer being the gold standard, the ongoing deliberation as to whether mercury sphygmomanometers should be replaced with the automated oscillometric devices stems from the risk mercury poses to the environment. AIM: This study was performed to check the validity of automated oscillometric blood pressure measurements as compared to the manual blood pressure measurements in Karachi, Pakistan. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood pressure was recorded in 200 individuals aged 15 and above using both, an automated oscillometric blood pressure device (Dinamap Procare 100) and a manual mercury sphygmomanometer concomitantly. Two nurses were assigned to each patient and the device, arm for taking the reading and nurses were randomly determined. SPSS version 20 was used for analysis. Mean and standard deviation of the systolic and diastolic measurements from each modality were compared to each other and P values of 0.05 or less were considered to be significant. Validation criteria of British Hypertension Society (BHS) and the US Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) were used. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were included. The mean of the difference of systolic was 8.54 ± 9.38 while the mean of the difference of diastolic was 4.21 ± 7.88. Patients were further divided into three groups of different systolic blood pressure <= 120, > 120 to = 150 and > 150, their means were 6.27 ± 8.39 (p‐value 0.175), 8.91 ± 8.96 (p‐value 0.004) and 10.98 ± 10.49 (p‐value 0.001) respectively. In our study 89 patients were previously diagnosed with hypertension; their difference of mean systolic was 9.43 ± 9.89 (p‐value 0.000) and difference of mean diastolic was 4.26 ± 7.35 (p‐value 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Systolic readings from a previously validated device are not reliable when used in the ER and they show a higher degree of incongruency and inaccuracy when they are used outside validation settings. Also, readings from the right arm tend to be more precise.

AB  -  Blood pressure (BP) readings taken by Omron HEM‐907XL were compared with the results obtained using sphygmomanometer (HgS) in 509 individuals using 2002 Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) criteria. With the exception of diastolic BP in youth ages 13 to 19 years (mean difference, ‐1.77 mm Hg; standard deviation, 8.65), the Omron device met the criteria. Agreement for hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) was above chance (k=0.68) and, compared with HgS, Omron underestimated the prevalence of hypertension by 2.65%. The Omron and HgS measurements were highly correlated (r=0.94 for systolic BP and r=0.83 for diastolic BP). Both increased systolic and diastolic BP decreased device agreement (β‐coefficient=‐0.10872, P<.0001; β‐coefficient=)0.25981, P<.0001, respectively). The Omron device meets AAMI criteria with the exception of diastolic BP in youth ages 13 to 19 years. However, Omron underestimated the prevalence of hypertension and device agreement decreases with increased systolic and diastolic BP. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  -  Ketanserin, an antagonist highly selective for 5‐hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) type 2 (S2) receptors, was given as monotherapy in a dose of 40 mg b.i.d. to 24 subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Its effects were evaluated in a placebo‐controlled double‐blind crossover study. The effect on blood pressure in 18 subjects was monitored by 24‐hour ambulatory intra‐arterial measurements. Systolic and diastolic intra‐arterial pressures were significantly lowered by ketanserin both during the day and at night, whereas heart rate was unchanged. Cuff pressure readings (triplicate measurements) with the London School of Hygiene sphygmomanometer and an automatic device (12 measurements in 1 hour) in the outpatient clinic also showed a significant effect on both supine and standing pressures. No postural hypotension was noted. Ketanserin had no effect on endogenous creatinine clearance, serum cholesterol levels, and the plasma levels of norepinephrine, renin, and aldosterone. The only side effect that was significantly more common with ketanserin than with placebo treatment was an increase in body weight. Ketanserin may have a place in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension.

AB  -  Objectives: 1 The difference between the informationized hypertension management model including "health manager" and the traditional hypertension management model. 2 Evaluate the economy‐benefit ratio. Methods: 1 From Marth to August 2017 we recruit 210, 40‐70 year old chengdu 1‐2 levels of mild hypertension patients in community, with bluetooth transmission device (Omron 1000), by mobile phone APP to view blood pressure etc.; 2The patients were randomly divided into group A and group B, group A (N = 112) or high blood pressure level 3 traditional management mode, west china hospitial doctor‐community doctor‐patient, each patient and community doctors communicate directly, including blood pressure cuff binding, mobile phone APP to upgrade and other technical problems and when the community doctors can't deal with it, then through the WeChat circle; 3 B group by using "health manager" new three‐level management pattern, the problems in patients with shunt, health administrators to be held by a nurse, mainly be responsible for the technical issues unrelated to blood pressure control, including the sphygmoma‐nometer binding, bluetooth connectivity, etc. 4 After 3 months, the blood pressure control rate was compared. Results: 1 The blood pressure control rates in group A/B were 65% and 72% respectively, and B group significant increse hypertension control (P < 0,05).2 After 3 months of follow‐up, it was found that 75% of the patients in the two groups came to the community, which had nothing to do with blood pressure control, which was mainly the problem of Internet application. Conclusion: 1. Under the Internet + era, the problem of hypertension community management is becoming more and more prominent. It is necessary to divide the patients' problems into treatment, reduce the cost benefit and increase the control.

AB  -  The well‐known limitations of traditional sphygmomanometer blood pressure measurements have led to the development of a number of invasive and non‐invasive 24‐h blood pressure monitoring techniques which provide information on blood pressure in daily life. A non‐invasive portable blood pressure monitor (IRC Spacelab S5300 monitor) was used to assess the antihypertensive action of celiprolol, 400 mg once daily, in a randomized, double‐blind, crossover, placebo‐controlled study. After a washout period of 7 days, 15 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension were subjected to three 24‐h blood pressure recordings: at the end of washout, and after 1 month of placebo and celiprolol treatment. In the 10 responsive patients, celiprolol reduced 24‐h systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate by 6.8%, 8.1% and 2.7%, respectively, when compared with placebo. The reduction in blood pressure was also evident during the night and the antihypertensive action of celiprolol was maintained 24‐h after administration. Celiprolol had no effect on 24‐h blood pressure or heart rate variability and, therefore, did not produce any alteration in cardiovascular homeostasis. These results demonstrate that celiprolol is an effective once daily treatment for hypertension.

AB  -  Purpose of Study: To assess knowledge of pediatric hypertension (HTN) and describe blood pressure (BP) screening and treatment practices among a group of primary care providers in the control arm of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to improve screening practices in pediatric primary care settings. Methods Used: Pediatric providers were enrolled in a RCTof a multifaceted intervention to improve screening in primary care settings. State Medicaid claims data from Alabama, South Carolina, and Illinois were used to identify eligible providers, defined as those that had seen at least 8 children ages 3 or 4 years old for well‐child visits over a 12 month period. Both intervention and control arm participants completed internet‐based educational modules, with control arm modules focusing on screening and evaluation for HTN. Enrolled providers were randomized at website login. Modules were case‐based and contained embedded questions to assess knowledge and practice. BP screening modules provided standardized pediatric BP tables for reference. Summary of Results: There were 65 respondents in the HTN module. BP measurement techniques were aneroid (42.4%), mercury (30.3%), and oscillometric (27.3%). Only 4 participants could correctly identify criteria for choosing cuff size relative to arm size; 24% reported choosing cuff size based on child's age and 32% based on manufacturer's markings. Age was correctly identified by the majority (96%) as a factor determining normal BP, but only about half identified height and gender as factors. Only 49% reported the incidence of HTN among obese adolescents to be as high as 25‐30%. Earliest age for routine BP screening was reported as 3 yrs by 64% (12 months 6%, 2 yrs 9%, 4 yrs 18%, teens 3%). No participants identified prematurity as reason for routine monitoring of BP in infancy. Of 4 cases presented, patients' BPs were correctly classified in 64‐80% (normal/borderline/stage 1 HTN/stage 2 HTN). In 2 scenarios of teenagers meeting diagnostic criteria for HTN (at least 3 elevated measurements on 3 different days), only 4 participants would start BP medications. Conclusions: About 1/5 of participants reported not initiating BP screening by age 3 years. Most participants were able to correctly classify BP severity using tables of standard BP norms. Few participants were comfortable starting BP medications in patients meeting diagnostic criteria for HTN.

AB  -  The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a fixed combination of benazepril (10 mg) and low‐dose amlodipine (2.5 mg) were assessed in 24 patients (mean age, 43.9 years) with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension [supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 95 and < or = 120 mm Hg)]. After 2 weeks of washout taking placebo, patients were randomized to receive the fixed combination or placebo, both administered once daily for 3 weeks, according to a double‐blind, crossover design. Patients were checked at the end of the washout period and every 3 weeks thereafter. At each visit, 24‐h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed by a noninvasive device (Spacelabs 90207); casual BP (by mercury sphygmomanometer), heart rate (HR), and body weight also were measured. The fixed combination significantly reduced systolic (SBP) and DBP values throughout the 24 h as compared with placebo, without affecting the normal BP circadian variability. The antihypertensive effect of the fixed combination could be observed to a similar extent during the day and night and was still significant 24 h after dosing. HR and body weight were not affected by the treatment. The fixed combination of benazepril 10 mg/amlodipine 2.5 mg was well tolerated, and no patient withdrew from the study because of side effects.

AB  -  A double‐blind, crossover, placebo‐controlled study was undertaken in order to assess the antihypertensive efficacy of a fixed combination of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide in two different dosages by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). After a three‐week placebo wash‐out period, 18 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, all males, aged 41‐60 years, were randomized to receive benazepril 5 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg, benazepril 10 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or placebo, all given once daily for 4 weeks, according to a 3 crossover period, arranged in a 3 x 3 latin square design. Patients were checked after the wash‐out period and every 4 weeks thereafter. At each visit, 24‐hour ABPM was performed by a non‐invasive device (Spacelabs 90202); causal BP (by mercury sphygmomanometer) and HR were also measured. Both dosages of the fixed combination were equally effective in reducing systolic and diastolic BP values throughout the 24‐hour period as compared to the placebo. The antihypertensive effect of the drug could be observed to a similar extent both during the day and night and was still significant 24‐hour post‐dosing. In addition, the fixed combination did not affect the normal BP circadian variability.

AB  -  Background: Studies evaluating titration of antihypertensive medication using self‐monitoring give contradictory findings and the precise place of telemonitoring over self‐monitoring alone is unclear. The TASMINH4 trial aimed to assess the efficacy of self‐monitored blood pressure, with or without telemonitoring, for antihypertensive titration in primary care, compared with usual care. Methods: This study was a parallel randomised controlled trial done in 142 general practices in the UK, and included hypertensive patients older than 35 years, with blood pressure higher than 140/90 mm Hg, who were willing to self‐monitor their blood pressure. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to self‐monitoring blood pressure (self‐montoring group), to self‐monitoring blood pressure with telemonitoring (telemonitoring group), or to usual care (clinic blood pressure; usual care group). Randomisation was by a secure web‐based system. Neither participants nor investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was clinic measured systolic blood pressure at 12 months from randomisation. Primary analysis was of available cases. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN 83571366. Findings: 1182 participants were randomly assigned to the self‐monitoring group (n=395), the telemonitoring group (n=393), or the usual care group (n=394), of whom 1003 (85%) were included in the primary analysis. After 12 months, systolic blood pressure was lower in both intervention groups compared with usual care (self‐monitoring, 137.0 [SD 16.7] mm Hg and telemonitoring, 136.0 [16.1] mm Hg vs usual care, 140.4 [16.5]; adjusted mean differences vs usual care: self‐monitoring alone, ‐3.5 mm Hg [95% CI ‐5.8 to ‐1.2]; telemonitoring, ‐4.7 mm Hg [‐7.0 to ‐2.4]). No difference between the self‐monitoring and telemonitoring groups was recorded (adjusted mean difference ‐1.2 mm Hg [95% CI ‐3.5 to 1.2]). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses including multiple imputation. Adverse events were similar between all three groups. Interpretation: Self‐monitoring, with or without telemonitoring, when used by general practitioners to titrate antihypertensive medication in individuals with poorly controlled blood pressure, leads to significantly lower blood pressure than titration guided by clinic readings. With most general practitioners and many patients using self‐monitoring, it could become the cornerstone of hypertension management in primary care.

AB  -  PURPOSE: Left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) remain highly frequent markers of cardiac damage and risk of progression to symptomatic heart failure, especially in resistant hypertension (RHTN). We have previously demonstrated that administration of sildenafil in hypertensive rats improves LVDD, restoring phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE‐5) inhibition in cardiac myocytes. METHODS: We hypothesized that the long‐acting PDE‐5 inhibitor tadalafil may be clinically useful in improving LVDD in RHTN independently of blood pressure (BP) reduction. A single blinded, placebo‐controlled, crossover study enrolled 19 patients with both RHTN and LVDD. Firstly, subjects received tadalafil (20 mg) for 14 days and after a 2‐week washout period, they received placebo orally for 14 days. Patients were evaluated by office BP and ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), endothelial function (FMD), echocardiography, plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP‐32), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and nitrite levels. RESULTS: No significant differences were detected in BP measurements. Remarkably, at least four echocardiographic parameters related with diastolic function improved accompanied by decrease in BNP‐32 in tadalafil use. Although increasing cGMP, tadalafil did not change endothelial function or nitrites. There were no changes in those parameters after placebo. CONCLUSION: The current findings suggest that tadalafil improves LV relaxation through direct effects PDE‐5‐mediated in the cardiomyocytes with potential benefit as an adjunct to treat symptomatic subjects with LVDD such as RHTN patients.

AB  -  Background: Advancements in technology over the last decades have brought a mini‐revolution into the centuries old technique of blood pressure (BP) assessment. Automated oscillometric BP devices allow not only to eliminate human error in BP readings, but more importantly they standardize the length of resting period and allow for unattended resting and BP measurement. BP thresholds for definition of hypertension as well as BP treatment targets are however largely derived from studies using mercury sphygmomanometers or non‐automated oscillometric BP devices. Comparative studies addressing the effect of standardized length of unattended resting and presence versus absence of medical personnel during BP measurement per se are however lacking. Methods and Population: In this prospective randomized, crossover trial we compared office casual BP readings to BP readings after 5 minutes unattended resting and unattended BP measurement. Additionally, we compared 5 minutes unattended resting and unattended BP measurement with medical personnel presence during BP measurement. BP readings were obtained from the same arm on 2 different visits using an automated oscillometric BP device (Omron HEM 907XL), one pre‐ and second one post 24‐hour ABPM. All patients followed at our regional, tertiary care hospital‐based Hypertension Centre were eligible for this trial. Results: 90 adult patients were consented and 79 (men 54% and women 46%) completed all the measurements. Mean casual BP was 137. 1 Â± 16.7, mean resting unattended BP was 130.1 Â± 13.7, indicating difference of 7.0 + 10.0 mm Hg (p < 0.0001). Mean resting attended BP was 129.3 Â± 13.2 (not statistically different from completely unattended resting B P, difference ‐ 2.7 [95% CI 1.4 ‐6.8] p = 0.18). Summary: Our study conclusively confirms that resting decreases blood pressure as assess from the difference between casual BP and BP obtained after 5 minutes of rest. More importantly, our study indicates that presence of medical personnel during BP measurements after initial 5 minutes unattended rest does not have a significant impact on overall resting BP readings. Conclusion: These data no superiority of fully automated devices versus semi‐automated devices for BP measurements.

AB  -  Recent multicenter trials have demonstrated that, in hypertensive elderly people, blood pressure control can significantly decrease the rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Twenty‐four‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has proved to be superior to isolated sphygmomanometer blood pressure readings in the diagnostic evaluation of hypertension and in assessing the blood pressure response to treatment. We used 24‐h ambulatory monitoring in a small, double‐blind, randomly‐allocated, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group study of antihypertensive treatment with lacidipine given once a day at 2 or 4 mg. In our elderly subjects, the lacidipine treatment provided adequate blood pressure control both by day and by night with no effect on the heart rate profile. Furthermore, after drug therapy, we found a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure variability (standard deviation). This study shows that lacidipine can provide adequate control of arterial hypertension in the elderly.

AB  -  Background: Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) side effects can impair quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis. Due to its particular mechanism of action, paracetamol might bypass these negative effects. Objectives: To determine both the role of paracetamol in the treatment of osteoarthritis patients and optimal combination of antihypertensives and antirheumatics for these patients. Methods: A prospective clinical trial in a family practice included 110 treated hypertensives aged over 55 years: 50 controls and 60 also taking NSAIDs for osteoarthritis. This 3‐month study compared two antihypertensives, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide fixed combination and amlodipine, with two NSAIDs, ibuprofen and Piroxicam, and with paracetamol. Following clinical work‐up and NSAID discontinuation for at least 3 days (run‐in period of only 3‐7 days), osteoarthritis subjects were randomized to 1‐month periods of ibuprofen (400‐600 mg t.i.d.) or Piroxicam (10‐20 mg o.d.) with one month of paracetamol (1000 mg t.i.d.) in the middle as a "wash‐out" interval, continuing the prescribed amlodipine (5‐10 mg o.d.) or lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide fixed drug combination (10/6.25‐20/12.5 mg o.d.), while control subjects (hypertensives with no osteoarthritis) were just keeping their antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure was measured with standard mercury sphygmomanometer and with an automatic device, in standing, sitting and supine position. The intensity of arthritic pain (on a visual analogue scale from 1 to 10, where 0 means "no pain" and 10 "the worst pain you may imagine") and the patient's quality of life estimate (on a visual analogue scale from 1 to 10, where 0 means "general condition excellent" and 10 "the worst possible") were recorded. Results: Blood pressure control was unchanged in the amlodipine group across the study periods and impaired in the lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide group during either ibuprofen or piroxicam, but not during paracetamol. In the amlodipine + ibuprofen subgroup, the reduction of the average pain intensity score throughout the study was significant (chi2=8.250; df 3; P=0.037). In the lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide + piroxicam subgroup, the assessed quality of life differed significantly (chi2=9.716; df 3; P=0.018), while in the amlodipine + ibuprofen and amlodipine + piroxicam subgroups the changes were marginal (chi2=6.936; df 3; P=0.072 and chi2=7.146; df 3; P=0.065, respectively). Discussion: In our trial, paracetamol had analgesic efficacy similar to ibuprofen and only marginally inferior to piroxicam. The analgesic effect of ibuprofen, piroxicam and paracetamol was more pronounced in amlodipine than in the lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide subgroups. The quality of life was reported to be worse with NSAIDs than with paracetamol, presumably due to dyspeptic problems. Although during the paracetamol phases, the quality of life was slightly improved, the difference was statistically nonsignificant because of the small samples and insufficiently sensitive scale. Conclusion: Analgesic efficiency of paracetamol is comparable to that of ibuprofen and is marginally inferior to piroxicam. Only paracetamol did not interfere with the antihypertensive effects of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination. Piroxicam and ibuprofen markedly blunt the effects of antihypertensive drugs while paracetamol is almost inert in this sense. Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination is much more affected by this interaction than amlodipine. Because of less side effects and better tolerability, paracetamol is the analgesic of choice for hypertensive patients with osteoarthritis, needed prolonged pain relief. The second choice drugs are narcotic analgesics (e.g., tramadol). Small doses of NSAIDs can eventually be added with concomitant prescription of gastroprotective agents.

AB  -  Background: Hypertension markedly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and overall mortality. Lifestyle modifications, such as increased levels of physical activity, are recommended as the first line of anti‐hypertensive treatment. A recent systematic review showed that isometric handgrip (IHG) training was superior to traditional endurance and strength training in lowering resting systolic blood pressure (SBP). The average length of previous IHG training studies is approximately 7.5weeks with the longest being 10weeks. Therefore, presently it is unknown if it is possible to further lower blood pressure levels beyond the 10‐week mark. Recently, we developed a novel method for monitoring handgrip intensity using a standard Nintendo Wii Board (Wii). The primary aim of this study is to explore the effects of a 20‐week IHG home training facilitated by a Wii in hypertensive older adults (50+years of age) on lowering SBP compared to usual care. Secondary aims are to explore if/when a leveling‐off effect on SBP will occur during the 20‐week intervention period in the training group and to explore adherence and potential harms related to the IHG home training. Methods/design: Based on previous evidence, we calculated that 50 hypertensive (SBP between 140 and 179mmHg), older adults (50+years of age) are needed to achieve a power of 80% or more. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention >group (IHG home training+hypertension guidelines on lifestyle changes) or to a control group (hypertension guidelines on lifestyle changes). Participants in the intervention group will perform IHG home training (30% of maximum grip strength for a total of 8min per day per hand) three times a week for 20weeks. Resting blood pressure and maximal handgrip strength will be obtained by a blinded outcome assessor in both groups at specific time points (baseline, follow‐up at 5, 10, 15, and 20weeks) throughout the study. Discussion: This assessor‐blinded, randomized controlled trial will explore the effect of a 20‐week IHG home training intervention on resting blood pressure in hypertensive older adults. In addition, the trial will report adherence and potential harms related to the IHG home training. Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of monitoring blood pressure by quantifying the probability that observed changes in blood pressure reflect true changes. DESIGN: Analysis of blood pressure measurements of patients in the perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study (PROGRESS). SETTING: Randomised placebo controlled trial carried out in 172 centres in Asia, Australasia, and Europe. PARTICIPANTS: 1709 patients with history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack randomised to fixed doses of perindopril and indapamide. Measurements Mean of two blood pressure measurements in patients receiving treatment recorded to the nearest 2 mm Hg with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer at baseline and then at three months, six months, nine months, and 15 months and then every six months to 33 months. RESULTS: There was no change in the mean blood pressure of the cohort during the 33 month follow‐up. Six months after blood pressure was stabilised on treatment, if systolic blood pressure was measured as having increased by >10 mm Hg, six of those measurements would be false positives for every true increase of >or=10 mm Hg. The corresponding value for an increase of 20 mm Hg was over 200. Values for 5 mm Hg and 10 mm Hg increases in diastolic blood pressure were 3.5 and 39, respectively. The likelihood that observed increases in blood pressure reflected true increases rose with the time between measurements such that the ratio of true positives to false positives reached parity at 21 months. CONCLUSIONS: Usual clinical approaches to the monitoring of patients taking drugs to lower blood pressure have a low probability of yielding reliable information about true changes in blood pressure. Evidence based guidelines for monitoring treatment response are urgently required to guide clinical practice. Trial registration Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry.

AB  -  INTRODUCTION: Arterial stiffness and aortic blood pressure (BP) augmentation are significantly increased in hemodialysis patients. Recent studies suggest that the prognostic significance of ambulatory recordings of arterial stiffness is high in hemodialysis. This study examines for the first time the effect of dry weight reduction with a standardized lung‐ultrasound‐guided strategy on ambulatory aortic BP and arterial stiffness parameters in hypertensive hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A total 71 hemodialysis patients with hypertension (mean home BP â‰¥135/85 mmHg), that were clinically euvolemic, were included in this single‐blind randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio in the active group (23 male and 12 female), following a strategy for dry‐weight reduction guided by the total number of US‐B lines (US‐B lines score) prior to a mid‐week dialysis session and the control group (24 male and 12 female), following standard‐of‐care treatment. All patients underwent 48‐hour ABPM with the Mobil‐O‐Graph monitor (IEM, Stolberg, Germany) and PWV measurement in office with SphygmoCor (ArtCor, Sydney, Australia) at baseline and after 8‐weeks. RESULTS: Overall, the US‐B lines change during follow‐up were ‐5.3Â±12.5 in active versus +2.2Â±7.6 in control group (p<0.001), which corresponded to dry‐weight changes of ‐0.71Â±1.39 versus +0.51Â±0.98 kg (p<0.001). The change in 48‐hour cSBP was significantly greater in the active group (‐6.30Â±8.90 vs ‐0.50Â±12.46, p=0.027); the relevant cDBP fall was marginally greater (‐3.85Â±6.61 vs ‐0.63Â±8.36, p=0.077) in the active group. 48‐hour cPP (41.51Â±9.63 vs 39.06Â±9.61 mmHg, p=0.004) and 48‐hour PWV (9.30Â±2.00 vs 9.08Â±2.04 m/sec, p=0.032) were significantly reduced from baseline to study‐end in the active group but remained unchanged in controls. In contrast, 48‐hour AIx and AIx(75) did not change between baseline and study‐end in both groups; changes in AIx(75) were similar in the two groups (‐0.97Â±3.51 vs ‐ 0.36Â±4.25, p=0.517). PWV measured in office was decreased from baseline to studyend in the active (10.07Â±2.66 vs 9.79Â±2.81, p=0.038) but not in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A lung‐ultrasound‐guided strategy for dry‐weight reduction reduces ambulatory aortic BP and ambulatory or office PWV, but not ambulatory AIx(75). These results suggest that dry‐weight reduction can primarily reduce aortic BP levels and large arteries stiffness but not wave reflections from the periphery.

AB  -  Despite the increasing popularity of blood pressure (BP) wrist monitors for self‐BP measurement at home, device validation and the effect of arm position remains an issue. This study focused on the validation of the Omron HEM‐609 wrist BP device, including an evaluation of the impact of arm position and pulse pressure on BP measurement validation. Fifty patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease were selected (age 65 + 10 years). Each patient had two measurements with a mercury sphygmomanometer and three measurements with the wrist BP device (wrist at the heart level while the horizontal arm supported [HORIZONTAL], hand supported on the opposite shoulder [SHOULDER], and elbow placed on a desk [DESK]), in random order. The achieved systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) wrist‐cuff readings were compared to the mercury device and the frequencies of the readings within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg of the gold standard were computed and compared with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) and Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) protocols. The results showed while SBP readings with HORIZONTAL and SHOULDER positions were significantly different from the mercury device (mean difference = 7.1 and 13.3 mmHg, respectively; P < 0.05), the DESK position created the closest reading to mercury (mean difference = 3.8, P > 0.1). Approximately 71% of SBP readings with the DESK position were within +10 mmHg, whereas it was 62.5% and 34% for HORIZONTAL and SHOULDER positions, respectively. Wrist DBP attained category D with BHS criteria with all three arm positions. Bland‐Altman plots illustrated that the wrist monitor systematically underestimated SBP and DBP values. However a reading adjustment of 5 and 10 mmHg for SBP and DBP (DESK position) resulted in improvement with 75% and 77% of the readings being within 10 mmHg (grade B), respectively. AAMI criteria were not fulfilled due to heterogeneity. The findings also showed that the mismatch between the mercury and wrist‐cuff systolic BP readings was directly associated with pulse pressure. In conclusion the DESK position produces the most accurate readings when compared to the mercury device. Although wrist BP measurement may underestimate BP measured compared to a mercury device, an adjustment by 5 and 10 mmHg for SBP and DBP, respectively, creates a valid result with the DESK position. Nevertheless, considering the observed variations and the possible impact of arterial stiffness, individual clinical validation is recommended. 2010 Adedoyin et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  -  Objective: To compare the effects of rilmenidine with those of amlodipine on blood pressure, glucose metabolism, plasma lipid concentration and fibrinolysis parameters. Design: A four‐month randomized double‐blind, parallel group study. Patients and methods: Obese hypertensive patients with hypertriglyceridaemia (> 2.3 mmol/l) and impaired glucose tolerance (OMS‐ADA) were included (n = 52). A placebo run‐in period of 2 weeks was followed by 4 months of double‐blind treatment with either rilmenidine or amlodipine. Blood pressure was recorded using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Glucose metabolism was evaluated by an oral glucose tolerance test. Results: Of the 52 patients recruited, 47 (21 rilmenidine and 26 amlodipine) completed the 4‐month treatment period. The intention‐to‐treat analysis showed a comparable reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) with the two anti‐hypertensive treatments (rilmenidine ‐13.9/‐13.5 mmHg; amlodipine ‐17.6/‐ 15.0 mmHg). Insulin concentrations under basal conditions and 2 h after a standard oral glucose load did not change significantly after treatment in both groups. Plasma glucose under basal conditions and 2 h after a standard oral glucose load as well as the area under the plasma glucose concentration curve tended to decrease in the rilmenidine group and to increase in the amlodipine group so that the changes in these parameters were significantly different between the two study groups (P = 0.041, P = 0.042 and P = 0.015, respectively). Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI‐1) antigen and PAI‐1 activity were only decreased in the rilmenidine group (not statistically significant). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that rilmenidine and amlodipine have a comparable anti‐hypertensive effect but only rilmenidine is able to improve glucose metabolism.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate by ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) the 24 hours antihypertensive efficacy of the fixed combination therapy, valsartan 80 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (V + H), once daily, after 6 weeks of treatment, in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. STUDY DESIGN: It was a French, multicenter, double blind, randomized trial in parallel groups comparing V + H and placebo. After an initial two weeks placebo period, patients were assigned to receive either V + H or placebo for six weeks. Were eligible those with clinical arterial blood pressure, measured by sphygmomanometer, between 160/95 and 209/114 mmHg after monotherapy. A 26 hours ABPM, with Spacelabs 90,207, was done at J0 and J42 (one measurement every 15 minutes, in day time and at night). Responders were defined as a fall in day diastolic blood pressure > or = 5 mmHg and/or day diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg with ABPM. RESULTS: 123 of the 138 randomized patients had two interpretative measurements. Their average age was 59 + 10 years. 57% (78) of them were males and their average ABPM before treatment was 143 +/‐ 15/88 +/‐ 11 mmHg. With V + H, the reduction of the systolic and the diastolic blood pressure measured by ABPM, was significantly more important than with placebo (SBP: ‐15.4 +/‐ 10.9 mmHg versus ‐0.6 +/‐ 7.7 mmHg, p < 0.001; DBP: ‐9.1 +/‐ 7 mmHg versus ‐0.4 +/‐ 5.4 mmHg, p < 0.001). Pulse pressure (PP) was also significantly reduced with the combination therapy V + H, but it was not modified with placebo (‐6.3 + 5.5 mmHg versus ‐0.2 + 4.1 mmHg, p < 0.001). ABPM responder rate was 73% with V + H versus 24% with placebo (p < 0.001). Trough/peak ratio was 80.3% for systolic blood pressure and 57.3% for diastolic blood pressure. The combination V + H was as well tolerated as placebo. CONCLUSION: The fixed combination V + H used for treatment of hypertension, after failure of monotherapy, is very effective in reducing pulse pressure, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, over 24 hours, homogeneously, and is as well tolerated as placebo.

AB  -  The acute and chronic effects of nipradilol on blood pressure were studied in 16 patients with essential hypertension (three men and 13 women, mean age, 60 plus or minus 12 years) with a blood pressure of greater than or equal to160/90 mmHg; a random measurement was made by 24‐hour monitoring of the blood pressure with noninvasive portable automatic sphygmomanometer before and after single administration of a 3‐mg nipradilol tablet (six patients) and daily administration of a 3‐mg nipradilol tablet twice daily (BID) (morning, evening) for two weeks (ten patients). The quantitative evaluation of the blood pressure during a 24‐hour period was made with the cumulative percentage method. Diastolic pressure began to decrease immediately after the administration, but the decrease in systolic pressure was slightly delayed. The duration of the hypotensive effect was longer for the diastolic pressure. After chronic administration of 3 mg BID for two weeks, a sufficient hypotensive effect was observed throughout the day but the duration of the effect on systolic pressure was slightly shorter. According to the cumulative percentage method, systolic pressure decreased by 8 mmHg (5.6%), from 143 to 135 mmHg, while diastolic pressure decreased by 10 mmHg (11.6%), from 86 to 76 mmHg, at the 50% level after chronic administration. These findings suggest that the hypotensive effect of nipradilol is derived from its vasodilating action. There was no difference in the extent of intraday variation of systolic or diastolic pressure between values before and after administration according to the cumulative percentage method, and nipradilol was considered to have no effect on the degree of daily fluctuation of blood pressure.

AB  -  Volunteers of study Participated of this study 15 hypertensive patients of both genders, five of them men. All participants were obese grade I and were using drug therapy. Were adopted as inclusion criteria: 1) be hypertensive; 2) age between 45 and 59 years old and 3) not perform regular exercise; 4) not use of beta‐blockers drugs and calcium channel blockers; 5) not be affected by labyrinthitis; 6) women be not in menopause, and, 4) be not practitioners of VGA. Already as exclusion criteria: 1) modifying the antihypertensive treatment during treatment; and 2) Not have developed the ability to play during the adaptation period. This study was approved by the Ethics in Research Committee of the University Hospital Lauro Wanderley under protocol nº 201/11 and after subjects having been cleared up all the procedures of the study, the subjects were asked to sign the Term of Free and Informed Consent (TFIC) according to the Resolution 196/96 of the National Health Council. Study Design The subjects were submitted to five protocols lasting 60 minutes: 1‐ Game in VGA (Dance Dance Revolution ®); 2‐ Walking/running reproducing the intensity obtained in the session with VGA; 3‐ Walking/running with intensity between 60% and 85% of MHR; 4‐ sedentary video game (VGS) and 5‐ A session control without exercise (CON), where participants remained at rest. The order of sessions was determined randomly and were carried at with a minimum of 48 hours between them. The intensity was monitored by measurements of HR and PE. BP and cardiac autonomic modulation (CAM) were assessed before and for a period of 60 minutes after exercise, at intervals of 10 minutes between each measurement. Adaptation to the game and instructions before study Before starting the experimental protocols, the volunteers performed three sessions of adaptation with 20 minutes duration each. In these sessions, they were instructed about the proper way of handling the VGA and VGS instruments, which were passed the necessary guidance on the different directions of arrows used in the game. These three sessions proved sufficient for them to understand the dynamics of the two games and obtain enough coordination to play without interruption. After adaptation period, a schedule was made with voluntaries to the experimental procedures and they were instructed not to drink caffeine‐containing foods and drinking alcoholic beverages for at least 48 hours before of the each experimental session. AVG and SVG procedures The VGA utilized was Dance Dance Revolution® (SSD Company Ltd., Shiga, Japan) to Playstation 2® (San Mateo, CA, USA). In this VGA the practitioner simulates a synchronized dance for footsteps ordered on a carpet (matpad) containing the areas to be trodden that replace traditional buttons of a control VGS. The style of the music used in the game is similar to those used in gyms. The game consists of passing arrows in four directions that appears on the screen at randomly and in the rhythm of different songs contained in the game. When the arrows pass on the screen, the player must step on the corresponding arrow on the carpet, in the music rhythm. At the end of each music, immediately next music was selected to minimize the time interval between them. Was connected to the video game a multimedia projector used as screen, where it was played the game image. The VGS game was the same as VGA, with the difference only that the carpet was replaced by joystick and volunteers remained seated during the game. Both sessions VGA as VGS lasted for 60 minutes. Heart rate was measured every 10 min using um heart rate monitor (Polar ® brand, model RS800CX, Polar ElectroOy, Kempele, Finland). Aerobic Exercise Protocol The subjects performed two aerobic exercise sessions lasting 60 minutes on a treadmill (Moviment® LX160i ‐ Brudden LTDA, Amazon, Brazil). One session was performed in intensity similar to the intensity reached during the session VGA and the other session was performed with moderate intensity (ranged between 60% to 85% of maximum reserve heart rate). Heart rate was monitored by heart rate monitor (Polar ® brand, model RS800CX, Polar ElectroOy, Kempele, Finland) every 10 minutes to ensure that volunteers maintain the predetermined intensity during exercise on treadmill. For the exercise protocol on the treadmill in the intensity of AVG, the lowest and highest measured heart rate found in the video game was adopted as a target zone for the heart rate on the treadmill. To the protocol on moderate intensity, the target heart rate was determined according to equation (equation 1) proposed by Karvonen, et al.20: Equation I FCT = FCR + i%(FCM‐FCR), FCT= heart rate training; FCR = heart rate at rest;; FCM = Maximum heart rate; i% = training intensity During the rest period the Subjective Perception Scale of Borg effort 21 was presented to the subjects with indices 6‐20 for the subjects become acquainted with fatigue stages that are from very mild to exhaustive. During the games or exercise on the treadmill, the PE was questioned every 10 minutes. Blood Pressure Monitoring After the arrival of the subjects to the data collection site, they were instructed to remain seated for 10 minutes in a quiet room, illuminated with controlled temperature between 295,1ºC and 298,1ºC and then was measured the baseline BP. New BP measurements were taken immediately after the end of exercise and for 60 minutes of the post exercise or video game procedures recovery every 10 minutes. BP was measured by auscultation, following strictly the protocol proposed in the VI Brazilian Guidelines on Hypertension22. For Was used a aneroid sphygmomanometer (WelkinAlllyn®, Skaneateles Falls, New York, USA) with an accuracy of two millimeters of mercury and previously calibrated against a mercury column and a stethoscope Premiun® mark (G‐Tech). Cardiac Autonomic Modulation (CAM) CAM was determined by recording the variability RR interval of HR, using the hear rate monitor Polar ® RS800CX (Polar ElectroOy, Kempele, Finland). The CAM was recorded after 10 minutes of initial rest and recovery post treadmill or video game procedures for 60 minutes every 10 minutes. Each measure lasted five minutes. Data were transported through an infrared device to a computer provided with software of the same manufacturer. The data are analyzed in the frequency domain (sympathetic‐vagal balance ‐ LF / HF) in software Kubios (University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland).

AB  -  We compared the blood pressure (BP) measurements obtained with a random‐zero sphygmomanometer and an ambulatory BP monitor in older persons with isolated systolic hypertension at one site of the multicenter, randomized, double‐blind clinical trial, the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) randomized clinical trial. The subjects were community‐dwelling elderly participants with isolated systolic hypertension enrolled in the SHEP study and already receiving stable doses of double‐blind medication (n = 35 for active treatment group; n = 32 for placebo group). We measured seated (clinic) BP obtained with a random‐zero sphygmomamanometer, pulse rate, and BP and heart rate measurements obtained with an ambulatory BP monitor (average 24 h, daytime, and nighttime BP and heart rate). Across treatment groups clinic and ambulatory systolic BPs were not significantly different, but the placebo group had higher ambulatory, but not clinic, diastolic BPs. Within each treatment group (active treatment and placebo) there were no significant differences between clinic and average 24 h, daytime, or nighttime ambulatory systolic BPs. There were also no significant differences between clinic diastolic BP and average 24 h, daytime, or nighttime ambulatory diastolic BPs in the active treatment group, but in the placebo group average 24 h diastolic BP obtained by the ambulatory monitor was 4.6 mm Hg higher than clinic diastolic BP (P = .001). The average 24 h heart rate was 6 to 7 beats/min higher as measured by the ambulatory monitor compared to clinic pulse (P < .01). In the placebo group of this study, average 24 h ambulatory diastolic BPs were consistently higher than clinic diastolic BPs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  -  A low‐cost, ambulatory blood‐pressure monitor has been calibrated and validated against a random zero sphygmomanometer. The repeatability of ambulatory pressure recordings after a placebo month in 44 mild to moderate untreated hypertensives was assessed. Systolic blood pressure showed a mean difference over 1 month of 2.0 mmHg, with a standard deviation of differences of 9.3 mmHg. The diastolic blood pressure mean difference was 0.1 mmHg (SD = 6.3 mmHg). This variability was much less than for clinic readings (SD = 17.3 mmHg) or for single home pressure readings (SD = 19.7 mmHg). Using ambulatory monitoring to detect a drop in pressure of 8/5 mmHg with a power of 0.9, the number of subjects needed in a parallel group trial is reduced from 360 to 68, and in a crossover study from 88 to 16 subjects. The usefulness of ambulatory pressure monitoring is demonstrated in a placebo‐controlled comparison of atenolol, nifedipine retard, or their combination in random order. Eleven subjects, 21‐60 years, with initial average blood pressures of 166.5/104.7 mmHg, showed a reduction in pressure with atenolol 50 mg a day of 15.1/10.0 mmHg, with nifedipine retard 20 mg b.i.d. of 21.0/11.6 mmHg, and with atenolol 50 mg and nifedipine retard 20 mg once a day of 26.2/16.8 mmHg. Ambulatory monitoring of pressure improved the accuracy of the trial and demonstrated a reduction in the alerting response with atenolol.

AB  -  Discrepancies between clinic and ambulatory BP measurements may be important in the assessment of antihypertensive drug efficacy. Trimazosin (50‐200 mg twice daily) and propranolol (40‐160 mg twice daily) were compared in 22 hypertensive subjects in a randomised double‐blind cross‐over study. Daytime ambulatory BP was measured with a non‐invasive portable recorder (Remler M2000). Clinic BP measurements were made with a random zero sphygmomanometer. While both drugs reduced clinic supine BP (trimazosin by 16/10 mmHg, P less than 0.01/P less than 0.001; propranolol by 25/14 mmHg, P less than 0.001/P less than 0.001), equivalent decreases on ambulatory measurement occurred with propranolol (28/11 mm/Hg, P less than 0.001/P less than 0.001) but not trimazosin (8/3 mmHg, P less than 0.05/NS). This difference in drug efficacy persisted throughout the 12‐hour dosing interval. We conclude that clinic BP measurements alone cannot be relied upon to reflect accurately changes in BP induced by antihypertensive drugs. Moreover this study confirms the necessity for ambulatory BP measurement in the evaluation of antihypertensive drugs.

AB  -  This multicentre study was aimed at comparing the trough effect of telmisartan and perindopril on diastolic blood pressure (DBP), using self blood pressure measurement (SBPM). A second objective was to compare the data obtained from SBPM with those provided by automatic office BP measurement. A total of 441 mild‐to‐moderate hypertensive patients were randomised to receive either telmisartan 40 mg or perindopril 4 mg for a period of 12 weeks. Patients whose clinic DBP remained higher than or equal to 90 mmHg at the end of the 6th week (W6) were given a double‐dose regimen. Office BP and SBPM were performed at baseline (W0), at W6 and at week 12 (W12), both with the same automatic device. A greater diminution of trough DBP was obtained with telmisartan (‐6.6 ± 6.7 mmHg) than with perindopril (‐5.1 ± 7.0 mmHg; P = 0.018). Regarding clinic BP, the same results were observed. Doubling dose was significantly less frequent with telmisartan (41%; n=85) than with perindopril (55%; n = 115, P = 0.005). Mean values of SBPM were lower than office BP values, with a difference of a greater importance at W0 than at W12: 6.6 vs 4.7 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (P<0.005) and 3.2 vs 1.4 mmHg for DBP (P<0.0001). At W12, isolated office hypertension was found in 9% of the patients (n = 37), while there were 14% of the patients (n = 55) with isolated home hypertension. In conclusion, the trough effect on DBP was statistically higher with telmisartan than with perindopril. SBPM values were lower than office BP values, with greater differences before than after treatment. About a quarter of the patients were found to be controlled with a method but not with the other one.

AB  -  Low‐dose thiazide‐type diuretics are recommended as initial therapy for most hypertensive patients. Chlorthalidone has significantly reduced stroke and cardiovascular end points in several landmark trials; however, hydrochlorothiazide remains favored in practice. Most clinicians assume that the drugs are interchangeable, but their antihypertensive effects at lower doses have not been directly compared. We conducted a randomized, single‐blinded, 8‐week active treatment, crossover study comparing chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day (force‐titrated to 25 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day (force‐titrated to 50 mg/day) in untreated hypertensive patients. The main outcome, 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, was assessed at baseline and week 8, along with standard office BP readings every 2 weeks. Thirty patients completed the first active treatment period, whereas 24 patients completed both. An order‐drug‐time interaction was observed with chlorthalidone; therefore, data from only the first active treatment period was considered. Week 8 ambulatory BPs indicated a greater reduction from baseline in systolic BP with chlorthalidone 25 mg/day compared with hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/day (24‐hour mean = ‐12.4+/‐1.8 mm Hg versus ‐7.4+/‐1.7 mm Hg; P=0.054; nighttime mean = ‐13.5+/‐1.9 mm Hg versus ‐6.4+/‐1.8 mm Hg; P=0.009). Office systolic BP reduction was lower at week 2 for chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day versus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day (‐15.7+/‐2.2 mm Hg versus ‐4.5+/‐2.1 mm Hg; P=0.001); however, by week 8, reductions were statistically similar (‐17.1+/‐3.7 versus ‐10.8+/‐3.5; P=0.84). Within recommended doses, chlorthalidone is more effective in lowering systolic BPs than hydrochlorothiazide, as evidenced by 24‐hour ambulatory BPs. These differences were not apparent with office BP measurements.

AB  -  Background: Management of hypertension is integral in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Poor adherence to medications results in suboptimal CVD risk reduction. We hypothesize that enrollment in a community‐based program focused on blood pressure assessment and reporting via telemedicine will result in increased medication prescribing and adherence. Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of a telemedicine trial of 241 patients with uncontrolled hypertension (BP>150/90 mmHg). Patients from two urban medical centers were randomized to usual care (control group‐C, N=122) or usual care with telemedicine (T, N=120). The T group was provided a digital sphygmomanometer and training on BP self measurement and reporting. Subjects were asked to report their BP twice weekly for 6 months. Patients also completed questionnaires to assess medication adherence, health knowledge, and physician lifestyle counseling practices. Results: The average age of patients was 59+/‐13 years and the proportion of African Americans was 80%. There was a statistically significant change in the number of antihypertensive medications prescribed to diabetic and non‐diabetics in the T group (2.3+/‐1.1 to 2.4+/‐1 (p=0.043); 2.1+/‐1.2 to 2.3+/‐1.2 (p=0.024) respectively), but not in the control group. Both the T and C groups demonstrated high levels of adherence. Antihypertensive medication adherence was not influenced by patient knowledge about diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia nor did physician specific factors including discussing lifestyle changes, reviewing medications, and number of encounters have any effect. Multivariate analysis showed that race, age, sex, education level, and income had no correlation to adherence. Conclusion: Participation in telemedicine increased the number of antihypertensives diabetic and non‐diabetic patients were prescribed hence encouraging better blood pressure management. Patient specific factors and physician counseling did not influence medication taking behavior. New multidisciplinary strategies must be developed to increase medication adherence to improve cardiovascular health.

AB  -  Background: Calcium channel blockers have been successfully used for the treatment of hypertension. In this study, the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers nifedipine coat core 30 mg and amlodipine 5 mg were evaluated. Methods: This multicenter, double‐ blind, prospective, randomized, parallel‐arm study com pared once daily administration of nifedipine coat‐core 30 mg with once daily amlodipine 5 mg in subjects with mild‐to‐moderate essential hypertension. A 4‐week placebo run‐in period was followed by an 8‐week active treatment period. Blood pressure reduction was measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and casual office blood pressure measured by mercury sphygmomanometer. Results: Nifedipine coat‐core and amlodipine produced equivalent reductions in mean diastolic blood pressure, as determined by 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was 5.4 mmHg and 5.8 mmHg for nifedipine coat‐core and amlodipine, respectively. Both drugs were well tolerated and neither treatment resulted in a significant change in heart rate. Conclusions: Nifedipine coat core 30 mg once‐daily is comparable to amlodipine 5 mg once‐daily for blood pressure reduction.

AB  -  Objective: This study was aimed to investigate the effects of olmesartan or nebivolol treatment on blood pressure and some endothelial function markers in newly diagnosed patients with stage 1 essential hypertension. Methods: This randomized open label study included 85 newly diagnosed patients with stage 1 hypertension (50 males, mean age: 52+9 years). Blood pressure, flow mediated vasodilatation (FMD) and echocardiographic measurements of the patients were taken before and 8 weeks after the beginning of treatment with olmesartan or nebivolol. Nitric oxide, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI‐1) and C reactive protein (CRP) levels measured in serum samples before and after treatment, were compared. Basal variables that can affect the antihypertensive response were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The reduction observed in the systolic and diastolic blood pressures after antihypertensive treatment was significant (p<0.05). FMD was significantly improved after treatment in both nebivolol and olmesartan groups; however, there was no significant difference between nebivolol and olmesartan groups (p=0.6). While CRP and PAI‐1 levels decreased, nitric oxide levels increased in both nebivolol and olmesartan treatment groups; but these changes were not statistically significant. No drug related complication was observed. Conclusion: This study has indicated that olmesartan and nebivolol causes similar changes in blood pressure response, FMD and endothelial function biomarkers improved. These results suggest that antihypertensive treatment, independent of the medication used, is associated with endothelial function improvement. 2014 by Turkish Society of Cardiology.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Combined treatment of a calcium antagonist and α/β‐adrenoreceptor blocker is expected to offer some advantages in the management of hypertension; however, their antihypertensive efficacy and safety remain relatively under‐explored. METHODS: The current study addresses the 24‐h antihypertensive efficacy and safety of arotinolol combined with a different calcium channel blocker. One‐hundred fifty‐two patients were randomly divided into three groups: nifedipine, amlodipine and felodipine group. In each group, the antihypertensive treatment dose was 30 mg/d, 5 mg/d, 5 mg/d long acting nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine plus 20 mg/d arotinolol, respectively. Blood pressure was measured in ABPM devices and mercury manometer. RESULTS: The result showed that the effective rate of one year antihypertensive treatment of arotinolol combined with nifedipine was 51 of 53, significantly effective (p < 0.05) among three combinations. It also showed that there was no statistical significant difference (p > 0.05) in controlled rate of morning peak blood pressure between treatment of arotinolol combined with amlodipine and arotinolol combined with nifedipine, but there was a significant difference (p < 0.01) in controlled rate of morning peak blood pressure between arotinolol combined with nifedipine vs. felodipine and arotinolol combined with amlodipine vs. felodipine. CONCLUSIONS: The therapy approached of arotinolol combined with nifedipine or amlodipine could be effective and well‐tolerated, and they can be used as the better chosen antihypertensive drug.

AB  -  Eligible participants with appropriately signed informed consent will be randomized to either the perindopril+amlodipin or perindopril+amlodipin+atorvastatin combinations. Patients will be preliminary screened before 7‐10 days for clinical and laboratory examination to meet eligibility criteria for inclusion in study. Perindopril+amlodipine combination doses will be up titrated over two weeks in case of need to control adequate arterial blood pressure < 140/90. The 4 doses combinations and their adjustments will be made by investigating physician according to guideline based treatment of arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia. Subjects should not previously be on statin therapy and subjects who needs to be will start atorvastatin in combination treatment pill . The investigators will study the effects of 6‐month treatment with perindopril +amlodipin+atorvastatin combination on plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Liver enzyme markers will be assessed in patients on additional statin treatment on day 90 for safety assessment. All participants will be followed‐up for 6 months. Inclusion criteria ‐ Patients aged between 45 and 85 years ‐ blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg with one antihypertensive drug or 150/100 mHg for untreated patients ‐ plasma LDL‐cholesterol concentrations > 2,5mm/L (without concomitant hypolipidemic drugs) ‐ at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor apart of arterial hypertension ‐ minimal thickness of intima media complex at least 0,8 mm. Exclusion criteria ‐ premenopausal females with potential for pregnancy ‐ angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy in the previous 3 months, ‐ initiation or change in dose of statin therapy within previous 3 months ‐ anticipated change in lipid lowering therapy ‐ acute coronary or cerebrovascular event within 2 months ‐ glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min ‐ previous history of side effects to RAAS inhibitors and Ca channel blocking agents ‐ inability to give informed consent ‐ inability to undergo carotid ultrasound examination. Adverse events (AE) Based on the intention‐to‐treat the patient population, safety will be checked by recording adverse effects throughout the study: severe AEs regardless as to whether or not there is causal relationship between the AEs and the study; and relevant AEs such as myalgia, cough , palpitations, peripheric edemas, diziness symptoms. When the investigators confirm these AEs, the grade of severity, procedures, outcomes, and relationship to the study drug will be assessed and recorded. Serious adverse event (SAE) A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase and at any dose of the investigational product that fulfills one or more of the following criteria: results in death, is immediately life‐threatening, requires in‐patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. The Investigator must inform the Sponsor of any SAE that occurs in the course of the study within 48 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Carotid Ultrasound An ultrasound linear probe with 5‐10 MHz linear transducer will be used for measuring the carotid artery intima media thickness ( IMT ). The carotid artery will be scanned by 3 trained in vascular ultrasound and echocardiography physicians. All study subjects will be examined in the supine position with the head tilted backward. Measurements of the left and right IMT of the posterior wall of the common carotid, 1 cm distal to the bulb bifurcation, by ultrasound 2D exam will be performed Blood pressure (BP) will be measured at the University Cardiology Clinic by a trained nurse or physician using a calibrated and validated digital sphygmomanometer. BP measurements will be taken with the patient in a seated position with the arm supported at heart level, after a 5 min rest and after abstaining from food, beverages containing caffeine, and smoking for at least 2 h prior to BP measurement. BP will be recorded as three serial measurements at intervals of 30 sec on both arms.

AB  -  Aortic blood pressure (BP) and 24‐h ambulatory BP are both better associated with target organ damage than office brachial BP. However, it remains unclear whether a combination of these two techniques would be the optimal methodology to evaluate patients' BP in terms of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) prevention. In 230 participants, office brachial and aortic BPs were measured by a validated BP monitor and a tonometry‐based device, respectively. 24‐h ambulatory brachial and aortic BPs were measured by a validated ambulatory BP monitor (Mobil‐O‐Graph, Germany). Systematic assessment of patients' LVDD was performed. After adjustment for age, gender, hypertension and antihypertensive treatment, septum and lateral E/Ea were significantly associated with office aortic systolic BP (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) and 24‐h brachial and aortic SBP and PP (P<0.04), but not with office brachial BP (P>0.09). Similarly, 1 standard deviation in SBP was significantly associated with 97.8+/‐20.9, 86.4+/‐22.9, 74.1+/‐23.3 and 51.3+/‐22.6 in septum E/Ea and 68.6+/‐20.1, 54.2+/‐21.9, 37.9+/‐22.4 and 23.1+/‐21.4 in lateral E/Ea, for office and 24‐h aortic and brachial SBP, respectively. In qualitative analysis, except for office brachial BP, office aortic and 24‐h brachial and aortic BPs were all significantly associated with LVDD (P<0.03), with the highest odds ratio in 24‐h aortic SBP. Furthermore, aortic BP, no matter in the office or 24‐h ambulatory setting, showed the largest area under receiver operating characteristic curves (P<0.02). In conclusion, 24‐h aortic BP is superior to other BPs in the association with LVDD.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Among the 65 million Americans with hypertension, only approximately 31% have their blood pressure under control (<140/90 mm/Hg). Despite the damaging impact of hypertension and the availability of evidence‐based target values for blood pressure, interventions to improve blood pressure control have had limited success. OBJECTIVES: A randomized controlled health services intervention trial with a two by two design is being conducted to improve blood pressure control. This five‐year trial evaluates two patient‐directed interventions designed to improve blood pressure control among patients diagnosed with hypertension in a community‐based primary care setting. METHODS: Patients are randomized to one of four groups: usual care, home blood pressure monitoring, tailored behavioral self‐management intervention that is administered via telephone by a nurse, or a combination of the home blood pressure monitoring and tailored behavioral intervention. Patients receiving the home blood pressure monitoring are trained in the use of an electronic blood pressure measurement device, are asked to measure their blood pressure 3 times/week, and send in two‐month blood pressure recordings throughout the 24‐month study duration. The behavioral intervention incorporates patients' need assessments and involves tailored behavioral and education modules to promote medication adherence and improve specific health behaviors. A nurse delivers all behavioral self‐management modules over the telephone bi‐monthly for 24 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who achieve control of their blood pressure based on evidence‐based guidelines (for patients without diabetes <140/90 mm/Hg, for patients with diabetes <130/80 mm/Hg) evaluated at six‐month intervals over 24 months (five measurements) using a random‐zero sphygmomanometer. CONCLUSION: Despite the known risk of poor blood pressure control, and the wide availability of effective treatment strategies, a majority of adults still do not have their blood pressure controlled. This study will be an important step in defining two explicit interventions to improve blood pressure control. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine both a tailored behavioral self‐management intervention and self‐monitoring home blood pressure intervention to improve blood pressure control among patients in a primary care setting.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Nocturnal blood pressure (BP) is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular events. The NOCTURNE study, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) using our recently developed information and communication technology (ICT) nocturnal home BP monitoring (HBPM) device, was performed to compare the nocturnal HBP‐lowering effects of differential ARB‐based combination therapies in 411 Japanese patients with nocturnal hypertension (HT).Methods and Results:Patients with nocturnal BP ≥120/70 mmHg at baseline even under ARB therapy (100 mg irbesartan daily) were enrolled. The ARB/CCB combination therapy (irbesartan 100 mg+amlodipine 5 mg) achieved a significantly greater reduction in nocturnal home systolic BP (primary endpoint) than the ARB/diuretic combination (daily irbesartan 100 mg+trichlormethiazide 1 mg) (‐14.4 vs. ‐10.5 mmHg, P<0.0001), independently of urinary sodium excretion and/or nocturnal BP dipping status. However, the change in nocturnal home systolic BP was comparable among the post‐hoc subgroups with higher salt sensitivity (diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and elderly patients). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first RCT demonstrating the feasibility of clinical assessment of nocturnal BP by ICT‐nocturnal HBPM. The ARB/CCB combination was shown to be superior to ARB/diuretic in patients with uncontrolled nocturnal HT independently of sodium intake, despite the similar impact of the 2 combinations in patients with higher salt sensitivity.

AB  -  The aim of this double‐blind randomized study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of trandolapril and nitrendipine in the elderly. After a 2‐week placebo period, patients received either trandolapril 0.5 mg or nitrendipine 10 mg, once daily for 15 days. At the end of this period, according to a forced titration, the dose was increased to 2 mg of trandolapril or 20 mg of nitrendipine once daily for 2 months. Seventy‐three hypertensive patients, aged 65 and over, entered the study. Demographic data and initial blood pressure (BP) level were comparable in the two groups. The antihypertensive effect, measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer, was assessed in 64 patients: SBP decreased by 18.6 +/‐ 12.1 mm Hg in the trandolapril (P < 0.001) and by 21.0 +/‐ 13.7 mm Hg in the nitrendipine group (P < 0.001); DBP decreased by 13.4 +/‐ 8.5 mm Hg in the trandolapril group (P < 0.001) and by 15.4 +/‐8.2 mm Hg in the nitrendipine group (P < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was seen between the two treatment groups. A sub‐group of 42 patients were evaluated by 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring. Mean 24 h ambulatory SBP/DBP decreases were 6.6 +/‐ 18.0/8.4 +/‐ 8.5 mm Hg in the trandolapril group (P < 0.001) and 5.7 +/‐ 11.1/7.2 +/‐9.6 mm Hg in the nitrendipine group (P < 0.001). The differences between the two treatment groups were not statistically significant. The antihypertensive action of trandolapril was sustained throughout the 24 h period with a trough‐to‐peak ratio of 70.2% for SBP and 70.9% for DBP. Nitrendipine exerted its action mainly during the day, with a very modest antihypertensive effect during the night and early morning; its trough/peak ratio was 25.9% for SBP and 28% for DBP. The tolerance of both treatments were good; seven patients were withdrawn from the trial for adverse events (four in the nitrendipine group, three in the trandolapril group).

AB  -  1. In arterial hypertension, aortic wave reflections contribute to determining central systolic and pulse pressures. The present study assessed the central pressure alterations at the level of the common carotid artery following 1 month treatment with perindopril or atenolol and investigated during the 8 h following drug intake. 2. Twenty patients suffering from permanent hypertension were included after a 4 week run‐in placebo period in a double‐blind, randomized cross‐over study comparing the angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril with the beta‐blocker atenolol during a 4 week treatment period. 3. Before and during the 8 h after drug intake, serial measurements included brachial artery systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP, respectively; mercury sphygmomanometer), carotid artery SBP and pulse pressure (PP; applanation tonometry), aortic pulse wave velocity (Complior; Colson, Les Lilas, France) and arterial wave reflections from the aorta (applanation tonometry; Sphygmocor; PWV Medical, Sydney, NSW, Australia). 4. Both treatments decreased brachial and carotid artery SBP, DBP and PP. Heart rate and pulse wave velocity decreased following atenolol (P < 0.001). Pulse wave velocity was reduced slightly following perindopril (NS). Arterial wave reflections were significantly (P < 0.001) decreased with perindopril in comparison with atenolol, but this effect on wave reflections was not associated with a larger decrease in carotid artery PP. 5. Thus, during chronic treatment, ACE inhibition and selective beta1‐adrenoceptor blockade resulted in a similar decrease in brachial and carotid artery PP, but only atenolol reduced heart rate. Aortic pulse wave velocity was reduced with both drugs, but atenolol appeared more effective in improving aortic stiffness. Arterial wave reflections were decreased only following perindopril. 6. Central pulse pressure was improved following 1 month treatment with an ACE inhibitor or beta‐adrenoceptor blockade following a decrease in arterial wave reflections with perindopril and a higher decrease in regional aortic stiffness with atenolol.

AB  -  Objective: Over three million people aged over 65 fall each year in the UK. Postural hypotension (PH) is a risk factor for falls. It is associated with excess mortality, and may affect cognition. PH is not routinely checked for in UK clinical practice. We studied the InCHIANTI dataset to derive and validate a simple prediction tool designed to facilitate identification of subjects to be checked for PH. Design and method: InCHIANTI is a population‐based study of ageing. It recruited subjects from population registries in Chianti, Italy in 1998 and they were followed up triennially. Blood pressure (BP) at recruitment was measured after resting supine, and one and three minutes after standing, using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Systolic PH was defined as a > = 20 mmHg fall in supine BP on standing. Subjects were randomised to derivation or validation cohorts; allocation was undertaken blinded to PH status and medical history. Candidate predictor variables identified from literature searches were tested for univariable cross sectional associations with PH using c2 tests. Those with significant associations were entered into multivariable linear regression models, and used to derive simple and weighted prediction scores (DROP scores). DROP scores were tested in the validation cohort for prediction of PH, future falls, cognitive decline and mortality rates. Results: PH was present in 56/726 (7.7%) of the derivation cohort and 45/727 (6.2%) of the validation cohort (p = 0.25). PH was associated with age > = 65, falls in the preceding year, diabetes, previous stroke, hypertension and Parkinson's disease. A simple score summing numbers of these variables performed equally well as weighted scores (AUROC 0.67 (0.59 to 0.74); p < 0.001). Rising DROP scores were incrementally predictive of future falls (χ2 for trend p < 0.01), increasing rates of decline in mini mental state examination (ANOVA p < 0.001) and mortality (HR 1.8 (1.6 to 2.0) per unit increment in DROP score; p < 0.001; figure). Conclusions: The DROP score can predict presence of PH, future falls, and increased rates of mortality and cognitive decline. Application of the score could facilitate detection and management of PH. External validation of the DROP score is underway. (Figure Presented).

AB  -  Background Nilvadipine may lower rates of conversion from mild‐cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (AD), in hypertensive patients. However, it remains to be determined whether treatment with nilvadipine is safe in AD patients, given the higher incidence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in this population, who may be more likely to suffer from symptoms associated with the further exaggeration of a drop in BP. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of nilvadipine in AD patients. Methods AD patients in the intervention group (n = 56) received nilvadipine 8 mg daily over 6‐weeks, compared to the control group (n = 30) who received no intervention. Differences in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, before and after intervention, was assessed using automated sphygmomanometer readings and ambulatory BP monitors (ABP), and change in OH using a finometer. Reporting of adverse events was monitored throughout the study. Results There was a significant reduction in the SBP of treated patients compared to non‐treated patients but no significant change in DBP. Individuals with higher initial blood pressure (BP) had greater reduction in BP but individuals with normal BP did not experience much change in their BP. While OH was present in 84% of the patients, there was no further drop in BP recorded on active stand studies. There were no significant differences in adverse event reporting between groups. Conclusion Nilvadipine was well tolerated by patients with AD. This study supports further investigation of its efficacy as a potential treatment for AD. Copyright 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  -  The study was designed to compare the efficacy of captopril and enalapril, both orally active inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, in the treatment of primary hypertension when administered in a single daily dose. After placebo washout for two weeks, 20 hypertensive patients (I‐II class, according to WHO), were admitted to active treatment, in a randomized sequence, with captopril (50 mg) and enalapril (20 mg) once a day in the morning (8 a.m.). Supine and erect blood pressure and heart rate were measured weekly, 24 hours after drug administration by using a mercury standard sphygmomanometer. In all patients ambulatory noninvasive blood pressure monitoring was performed after 4 weeks of treatment. The data confirmed the efficacy of both drugs in lowering blood pressure. However, while the antihypertensive effect of enalapril was prolonged throughout 24 hours, captopril was effective only for about 22 hours, a period longer than previously suggested on the basis of serum ACE inhibition, but not sufficient to cover the whole day. Therefore, if captopril therapy has to be used in a single daily dose an attempt should be made using an increased dosage or by employing the drug in some retarded pharmaceutical form. The need to prolong the antihypertensive effect of captopril to 24 hours is based on the clinical experience according to which the smaller the number of tablets to be taken the better the compliance. This is particularly true for cases of asymptomatic hypertension which nevertheless require lifelong therapy.

AB  -  We have undertaken a randomized, observer‐blinded comparison of three different methods of assessing blood pressure in 40 outpatients with hypertension complicating diabetes mellitus: the Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer (RZS) by two observers using a dual headed stethoscope; the semi‐automated Dinamap monitor, and 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) using a Spacelabs 90207. The techniques were compared by plotting the difference against average of readings obtained by combinations of two techniques (RZS observer 1 vs 2; RZS (mean observer 1 and 2) vs Dinamap; RZS (mean observer 1 and 2) vs daytime ABPM; and Dinamap vs daytime ABPM). There was good agreement of readings with RZS, observers 1 and 2 and RZS with Dinamap and daytime ABPM. When the three methods were used to classify blood pressure control according to BDA criteria, it was found that they produced equivalent results and although mean systolic pressures appeared lower with ABPM this did not reach statistical significance. Overall control of systolic blood pressure was classified as unsatisfactory in 82% of patients, diastolic blood pressure was unsatisfactory in 55%. Fifty‐five percent were determined to be nocturnal 'non‐dippers' by ABPM. They were older: median age 62.9 (range 35.9‐83.5) years compared to 48.2 (32.4‐70.0) years for 'dippers' (p<0.05). Thirteen of the 18 patients who did dip overnight had creatinines within the normal laboratory range, whereas only 6 of 22 'non‐dippers' had normal creatinines (median 91 (56‐768) micromol l(‐1) for 'dippers' vs 166 (76‐479) micromol l(‐1) for 'non‐dippers', p < 0.001). Nineteen of the 29 males studied were 'non‐dippers' compared with only 4 out of 11 females (p < 0.001). There was no association between dipper status, duration or type of diabetes or presence of proteinuria.

AB  -  RATIONALE AND STUDY DESIGN: This study assesses safety and efficacy when hypertensive patients convert from an oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, quinapril, to its intravenous counterpart, quinaprilat, and evaluates the need for short‐term conversion from oral to parenteral therapy. Blood pressure was measured by clinical measurements using a sphygmomanometer and by 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. During a placebo‐baseline phase, patients blood pressure had to increase within 3 days in the absence of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Responding patients were stabilized on oral quinapril and then randomized to 3 days of double‐blind treatment with one 5 ml or 10 ml injection twice daily of quinaprilat or placebo. RESULTS: Overall response to quinaprilat in ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and clinic blood pressure measurements was not statistically or clinically different from the response to oral quinapril therapy during baseline. Withdrawal from quinapril resulted in clinically significant increases in all blood pressure measurements compared with baseline therapy; the differences between placebo and quinaprilat therapy were statistically and clinically significant. Two patients treated with quinaprilat withdrew due to hypotension; one patient required a dosage reduction. Parenteral quinaprilat safely maintained blood pressure control whereas placebo control did not during the 72‐h interruption of quinapril.

AB  -  In underserved populations, inadequate surveillance and treatment allows hypertension to persist until actual cardiovascular events occur. Thus, we developed an Internet‐based telemedicine system to address the suboptimal control of hypertension and other modifiable risk factors. To minimize cost, the subjects used home monitors for blood pressure (BP) measurements and entered these values into the telemedicine system. We hypothesized that patients could accurately measure their BP and transmit these values via a telemedicine system. Inner city and rural subjects (N = 464; 42% African‐American or Hispanic) with 10% or greater 10‐year risk of cardiovascular disease and with treatable risk factors were randomized into two groups, control group (CG) and telemedicine group (TG). Each subject received a home sphygmomanometer with memory. The TG recorded and entered BP at least weekly. During office visits, the BP meters were downloaded and recorded BP compared to BP values transmitted via telemedicine. The telemedicine (T) BP values were similar to the meter recorded (R) values (T: systolic/diastolic BP 133.4 +/‐ 11.1/77.5 +/‐ 6.8 mm Hg, and R: systolic/diastolic BP 136.4 +/‐ 11.9.4/79.7 +/‐ 7.5 mm Hg). The percent error was <1% for both systolic (‐0.02 +/‐ 0.04%) and diastolic (‐0.03 +/‐ 0.04%) BP. Lastly, the telemedicine BP values were similar to the office (O) BP values for systolic and diastolic BP (T: systolic/diastolic BP 133.4 +/‐ 11.1/77.5 +/‐ 6.8 mm Hg, and O: systolic/diastolic BP 136.3 +/‐ 20.5/78.1 +/‐ 10.5 mm Hg). In underserved populations, this inexpensive approach of patients using a home monitor and entering these values into a telemedicine system provided accurate BP data.

AB  -  Introduction: Hypertension is an iceberg disease with high morbidity and mortality and is a silent threat to the health of the people both in developed and developing countries. The root cause of hypertension may present since childhood. Excess adiposity is the single most powerful risk factor for higher BP and contributes to more than half of the risk for developing hypertension. Hence early detection and intervention may prevent long term co‐morbidities Aim and Objectives: 1. To find prevalance of prehypertension in medical students. 2. To find correlation of prehypertension with the BMI. Materials and methods: A total of 208 medical students were selected randomly for this study. Mercury sphygmomanometer was used to measure BP, Stadiomter for height & Excell Simplified Digital weighing machine for weight. Data was analyzed by SPSS ver. 23. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Out of 208 students, 96 were male and 112 were female. Overall, the prevalence of prehypertension was 50.96% out of which males contribute (56.25%) and females (46.43%). We have also found a significant correlation between BMI and raised BP. Conclusion: The prevalence of prehypertension among the medical students of Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital is 50.96%(male>female) & there is a significant correlation between BMI and raised BP. Hence early detection and intervention may prevent long term co‐morbidities.

AB  -  The feasibility of self‐measurement (SM) of the blood pressure (BP) is well demonstrated in hypertensive patients (pts) but, in elderly pts physical and intellectual limitations can restrict the use of SM. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility of SM as a function of autonomic psychomotricity in pts aged more than 75 years and to estimate the reproducibility of SM in comparison with office's measurements (OM). We initially proposed the use of SM devices of BP to 53 pts aged > 75 years. One‐third of pts refused to participate in the study. In 32 pts we did a mini‐mental‐state score (MMS) and an evaluation of autonomic functions (IADL). Two patients with a MMS < 20 were excluded. The OM of BP was done in sitting position with a mercury sphygmomanometer (4 measures) and the SM by a Omron device during 5 consecutive days (3 measures morning and night). Eighteen (60%) pts did more or equal to 15 measures (good measurer) and 12 less than 15 (bad measurer). The pts of the group "good measurer" were significantly younger, were all hypertensive treated patients and had a higher MMS and a lower IADL than those of the group "bad measurer". Considering the differences (OM‐SM), 55% of patients showed values superior to 10 mmHg for systolic blood pressure, and 64% of subjects had values superior to 5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. We conclude that the SM is acceptable by patients older than 75 years and that feasibility is optimal in those patients where the autonomic and cognitive functions are preserved and when the patient is hypertensive. Also, as the concordance between OM and SM of patients older than 75 years is below 50%, diagnostic and therapeutic decisions based on OM is hazardous in these patients.

AB  -  Arterial effects evaluated by carotid‐femoral, brachial‐radial, and femoral‐tibial pulse wave velocity and antihypertensive effect evaluated by 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring were measured in 17 hypertensive patients before and 24 h after once‐daily nitrendipine (20 mg) administration. After a 15‐day placebo period, a double‐blind study of nitrendipine versus placebo was performed for 1 month. After nitrendipine dosing, BP measured by sphygmomanometer 24 h after the last drug intake showed a significant decrease as compared with the pretreatment period. Ambulatory BP mean values were also significantly decreased for systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP). This decrease predominated during the day but was observed nocturnally only after 6 a.m. Twenty‐four hours after the last tablet intake of nitrendipine, carotid‐femoral and brachial‐radial pulse wave velocities were significantly reduced, whereas femoral‐tibial wave velocity was unchanged, indicating that markers of arterial rigidity might be substantially modified and that the modifications were partly unrelated to BP changes. The results provide evidence that in hypertensive subjects nitrendipine 20 mg given once daily for 1 month produces an arterial effect for 24 h, in association with BP reduction.

AB  -  The antihypertensive effect of daily doses of three beta‐adrenoblockers (Bisoprolol, 10 mg once a day, propranolol, 80 mg twice a day, and methoprolol, 100 mg twice a day), and placebo was examined in 14 patients with persistent mild and moderate hypertension during a double blind cross‐over study by using 24‐hour monitoring of blood pressure and its routine measurements. The latter made by a mercury sphygmomanometer indicated that the antihypertensive and negative chronotropic effect of Bisoprolol in a dose of 10 mg remained 24 hours after its administration and it did not significantly differ from that of the two other agents given in the above doses. The application of 24‐hour blood pressure monitoring allows a more pronounced antihypertensive effect of bisoprolol to be revealed during 24 hours than that displayed by the two agents. Bisoprolol is an effective and safe antihypertensive agent.

AB  -  OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of white coat hypertension and white coat effect among hypertensive pregnant women and to assess whether the presence of a significant white coat effect was associated with adverse pregnancy outcome when clinical management was based upon standard sphygmomanometric blood pressure recordings. DESIGN: Prospective blinded studies assessing the presence of a white coat effect. SETTING: Antenatal ward and pregnancy day assessment unit of St George Hospital, a teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. POPULATION: One hundred and twenty‐one hypertensive pregnant women in the second half of their pregnancy admitted to hospital or the day assessment unit for management of their hypertensive disorders. METHODS: Routine sphygmomanometric blood pressures were recorded by midwives in the ward or day assessment unit and awake blood pressure recordings were averaged. These blood pressures were compared with average awake blood pressures recorded by ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) (Spacelabs 90207, Seattle, Washington, USA). White coat hypertension was defined as an average sphygmomanometer blood pressure > or = 140 mmHg systolic and/or > or = 90 mmHg diastolic with awake ABPM average blood pressure within the normal range for ABPM‐derived blood pressures in pregnancy, according to gestation. White coat effect was the difference between average sphygmomanometer blood pressure and average awake ABPM‐derived blood pressure. All clinical management was based upon routine sphygmomanometer recordings and clinicians were blinded to ABPM data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of white coat hypertension and white coat effect; maternal and fetal outcomes in those with and without a white coat effect of > or = 20 mmHg systolic and/or > or = 10 mmHg diastolic. RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic white coat hypertension were present in only 3.2% and 4.2% of the group, respectively. A systolic white coat effect > or = 20 mmHg was found in only 4.2% but 20.2% (26% for day assessment unit patients vs 15% for inpatients; P = 0.17) had a diastolic white coat effect > or = 10 mmHg. There was no difference in maternal or fetal outcomes between women with and without a white coat effect. CONCLUSIONS: White coat hypertension is an infrequent occurrence in mildly hypertensive pregnant women. Although a white coat effect is present more often, this is associated with clinical outcomes similar to women who do not exhibit this phenomenon. Using ABPM to identify a white coat effect in women presenting with hypertension in the second half of their pregnancy does not appear to be clinically useful.

AB  -  Blood pressure variability is an important consideration in hypertension trials for determining required sample size and consequently making accurate outcome statements. The Hypertension Prevention Trial was a randomized controlled trial carried out in 1983‐1986 in four US clinics on men and women with high normal diastolic blood pressure. This trial provided an opportunity to assess conditions affecting blood pressure measurement variability. Trained blood pressure observers measured systolic and diastolic blood pressures twice, 30 seconds apart, using a random‐zero sphygmomanometer. The quality of blood pressure measurements was assessed by computing the variability of the two readings per participant‐visit for each blood pressure observer at each study clinic. Other sources of variability investigated included observer digit preference, time of day, and ambient temperature. On the basis of data from this population, it is estimated that the standard deviation of blood pressure values can be reduced by 5% by taking two measurements per participant‐visit. An additional reduction of variability can be effected by having the duplicate blood pressure measurements made by different blood pressure observers. In special instances where the range of blood pressure values is very restricted, use of the random‐zero sphygmomanometer can increase or decrease the among‐participant variability in blood pressure values, depending upon where the distribution of blood pressure values is centered.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of triple therapy with azilsartan (AZI), amlodipine besylate (AML), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) compared with dual therapy with AZI/AML or HCTZ monotherapy were evaluated in Japanese essential hypertensive patients in a double‐blinded manner. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 353 patients with office blood pressure (BP) of at least 150/95 mmHg were randomized to a 10‐week treatment with AZI/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5 mg, AZI/AML/HCTZ 20/5/6.25 mg, AZI/AML 20/5 mg, HCTZ 12.5 mg, or HCTZ 6.25 mg. RESULTS: The mean change from baseline in office diastolic/systolic BPs at week 10 was ‐25.9/‐41.4, ‐24.9/‐38.6, and ‐22.4/‐34.5 mmHg in the AZI/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5 mg, AZI/AML/HCTZ 20/5/6.25 mg, and AZI/AML 20/5 mg groups, respectively. AZI/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5 mg led to a significantly greater reduction in diastolic and systolic BP than the dual therapy. In addition, the change in home diastolic BP measured with telemetry devices showed a significant difference between the two triple therapy groups. The incidences of adverse events except dizziness postural were similar among the treatment groups in the triple therapy groups. CONCLUSION: Triple therapy with AZI/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5 mg shows a greater antihypertensive effect than the dual therapy and has acceptable safety profiles for Japanese essential hypertensive patients. It was also observed that home BP measurement by automated telemetry could detect changes in BP that were not detected in office BP measurement, although further investigation is needed.

AB  -  46 patients (39 males), mean age 51 years (range 33‐66), were randomly allocated to two different groups of treatment if their diastolic blood pressure was superior to 90 mmHg after a one‐month treatment by 20 mg of enalapril. In the first group (ENA), 23 patients were given higher dosages of enalapril (40 and, if necessary 60 mg once‐a‐day). In the second group (HCTZ) 23 patients were given enalapril 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 and, if necessary, 50 mg once‐a‐day. Dosages were eventually increased after 2 weeks and evaluation of the results was performed after 4 weeks on treatment. Blood pressure was monitored in the supine position, at 3 minutes interval for thirty minutes, by an automatic device based on oscillometric method. Two successive measurements with a standard sphygmomanometer were performed by the physician at the end of the recording. No patient withdrew from the study nor was lost to follow‐up. At the end of the study, 14 patients in the ENA group were receiving enalapril 60 mg once‐a‐day and 8 patients in the HCTZ group were receiving 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Blood pressure was significantly lower in teh HCTZ group with the automatic device (130 +/‐ 9/80 +/‐ 8 vs 141 +/‐ 5/86 +/‐ 8 mmHg, p less than 0.01/p less than 0.05) and with the sphygmomanometer (134 +/‐ 10/89 +/‐ 6 vs 149 +/‐ 16/94 +/‐ 5 mmHg, p less than 0.001/p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  -  Objective: Carotid‐femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) is the gold standard for the assessment of arterial stiffness. This study validated automated brachial‐ankle PWV (baPWV) measured using the oscillometric BP monitor Microlife WatchBP Office PWV‐ABI versus cfPWV (Complior device). Design and method: Subjects recruited from a hypertension outpatient clinic and healthy volunteers were subjected to duplicate baPWV and cfPWV measurements in randomized order, and carotid ultrasonography. Results: Of 102 subjects recruited, automated measurement of baPWV was feasible in 101. Four had peripheral artery disease (ankle brachial index <0.9) and very low difference between baPWV and cfPWV (1.2 Â± 2 m/s) and were excluded. Thus, 97 subjects were analyzed (age 58.3 Â± 11.4 years, men 70%, hypertensives 76%, diabetics 17%, with cardiovascular disease 10%, smokers 23%). The mean difference between baPWV (13.1 Â± 1.8 m/s) and cfPWV (9.1 Â± 1.8 m/s) was 4.0 Â± 1.4 m/s (p < 0.01) with close association between them (r = 0.7, p < 0.01). Both baPWV and cfPWV were correlated with age (r = 0.54 and 0.49 respectively), systolic blood pressure (r = 0.45 and 0.5), carotid intima‐media thickness (r = 0.31 and 0.44) and carotid distensibility (r = ‐0.47 and ‐0.34) (all p < 0.05; no difference between the two methods, z‐test). The agreement between the two methods in the identification of subjects at the top quartile of their distributions was 77% (kappa 0.39, p < 0.01). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for cfPWV and baPWV were comparable for identification of carotid plaques (0.79 and 0.74 respectively). One observer was needed to perform baPWV measurements and two observers for cfPWV. The average time required for duplicate automated baPWV measurement was 6.9 Â± 0.8 versus 6.7 Â± 1.2 min for cfPWV (p = NS). Conclusions: Automated baPWV measurement is feasible, observer‐independent and strongly correlated with cfPWV and both indices exhibit similar associations with carotid damage. In patients with peripheral artery disease automated baPWV may not be accurate; however PWV measurement in such high risk cases is probably meaningless.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: 1. The intervention group, on top of standard antihypertensive medication (calcium channel blocker, alpha and beta blocker) will receive ARB (losartan) among post dialysis euvolumic hypertensive patients. 2. The ARB used for current RCT is “Losartan”. The selection of Losartan was based on availability, cost effectiveness and expert opinion of a Nephrologist and a cardiologist. Starting dose of 50 mg/day of losartan oral tablet will be given to recruited patients. Persistent high post dialysis blood pressure of >160mmHg or unable to attain targeted blood pressure of 140mmHg for a period of four months, upon consultation with a cardiologist and nephrologists the dose of losartan will be titrated up to 100mg/day. Moreover, based on patient response to initial 50mg/day dose, cardiologist may titrate the dose up to 100mg/day before 4 months so as to avoid any detrimental effect on subject health.(NKF KDOQI guideline 2004, to be followed for dose titration) A person in family of the patient will be asked to monitor the adherence of given medication. contact number and frequent meeting with the designated person will be arranged with the investigator to closely monitor the adherence of medication. 3. The maximum study duration is 8 months. Since there are two intervention dose of losartan, a 4 month period of each dose (50mg/day, 100mg/day) will be allowed to note patient response. Failure to achieve and maintain targeted systolic blood pressure of <140mmHg for three weeks with 50mg/day dose during the first 4 months, the subjects will be titrated to 100mg/day for next 4 months or if study end point achieved (maintaining<140mmHg for three weeks) 4. Dose of losartan to be administered at morning after breakfast except on dialysis session days, to avoid any incidence of hypotension. CONDITION: hypertension in End stage renal disease PRIMARY OUTCOME: the primary end point includes attaining post dialysis systolic blood pressure of <140mmHg and maintaining it for three weeks. Outcome will be assessed on proportion of patients achieving systolic blood pressure of <140mmHg for three weeks within 8 months of study duration ; outcomes will be monitored by blood pressure monitoring device (automatic sphygmomanometer). Blood pressure will be monitored 30 minutes post dialysis till study end point is achieved or maximum duration of 8 months SECONDARY OUTCOME: The secondary point will be all cause of mortality. ; A validated data collection tool will be formed to record all patient finding related to study. in case of mortality, all patient records and consultation with the doctor will be assured to confirm the cause of mortality ; INCLUSION CRITERIA: Euvolumic patients with blood pressure more than 140/90 mmHg post dialysis will be included for the study. On basis of expert opinion from nephrologists, patient 30‐80 years were included for current study. Finally, patients undergoing dialysis duration of at least 12 months, 2 to 3 HD sessions weekly and Patients willing to participate were included for current study.

AB  -  A double‐blind, comparative and prospective study with nifedipine once a day was undertaken, in patients with mild and moderate high blood pressure. Blood pressure was measured by mercury sphygmomanometer in two positions: resting and sitting at 3, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment and by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) over 24 h; both were carried out before and after the treatment and the uniformity in the pressure levels were obtained by means of the Smoothness Index. Fifty‐four patients were included in the trial, 28 in the microgranules group and 26 in the osmotic pump group. These groups were similar at the baseline in age, gender, weight, height, diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The nifedipine microgranules group had a heart rate higher than the nifedipine osmotic pump group at baseline (XM = 75.58 vs XB = 70.75). Blood pressure decreased significantly during the first 3 weeks; 85% in the microgranules group and 75% in the osmotic pump group reached a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg at the end of the study. Three patients in the microgranules group and two in the osmotic pump group required an additional antihypertensive drug. In both groups, the average blood pressure over 24 h was lowered without differences between groups. A decrease was induced in the heart rate in both groups which reached a marginal statistical significance in the microgranules nifedipine group. No changes were induced in the laboratory tests; two patients in the microgranules (8%) nifedipine group and five in the nifedipine osmotic pump group, adverse effects were observed, of which only one in each group required stopping the treatment.

AB  -  Background: Stress is known to contribute to obesity and hypertension and both are considered to be primary risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Green coffee bean extract (GCBE) contains chlorogenic acid (CGA) which is attributed with several health benefits including anti‐obesity and anti‐hypertensive effects. Objectives: To investigate the short term effects of GCBE intake on blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI) and anthropometric parameters in healthy volunteers. Methodology: A single blinded cross‐over placebo controlled study was performed on 16 healthy volunteers who consumed either GCBE or caffeine as placebo. The volunteers took the interventions for a week with a one‐week washout period in between before switching intervention groups. Results: After administration of GCBE (equivalent to 500mg of CGA/day) for seven days, participant's diastolic and systolic blood pressures were significantly reduced from 76.9+/‐ 9.1 at baseline to 72.6+/‐5.9mmHg (p<0.001), and from 119.1+/‐11.9 to 114.5+/‐9.6 mmHg (p=0.001), respectively. Body mass index (BMI) and body weight were also significantly reduced following GCBE intake. NO significant changes in these parameters were observed after the placebo. Conclusion: This study showed that 500mg CGA/day can significantly reduce blood pressure (BP), BMI and weight of healthy individuals. Copyright © 2016 DAR Publishers/The University of Jordan.

AB  -  INTRODUCTION: The European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA) has been planned to investigate the effect of reduction in office and ambulatory blood pressure by lacidipine versus atenolol on carotid artery wall thickness in mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients with no metabolic abnormalities. One prespecified sub‐study of ELSA focused on measurements of arterial distensibility in the carotid as well as in the radial artery to determine the relationship of functional arterial properties with office versus ambulatory blood pressure (BP) values as well as the correspondence between functional and structural arterial alterations. METHODS: The sub‐study was conducted on 124 patients recruited in four centres (Monza‐Milan, Paris, Grenoble and Glasgow). BP was measured both by a mercury sphygmomanometer and by 24‐h ambulatory monitoring. Common carotid artery wall thickness was measured by certified sonographers as described in the main study. Common carotid and radial artery distensibility were obtained by echotracking techniques, which allowed to relate changes in arterial diameter with systo‐diastolic BP changes. RESULTS: Carotid artery wall distensibility showed (1) a negative correlation with office and more so 24‐h average systolic BP (r = ‐0.45 and ‐0.58, P < 0.008 and 0.001) but not with office or 24‐h diastolic BP) and (2) a negative correlation with the corresponding wall thickness (r = ‐0.47, P < 0.005). In contrast, at the radial artery level distensibility and thickness showed no correlation with each other and with BP. Carotid (but not radial) artery distensibility also correlated with ambulatory systolic BP variability but the correlation was lost after adjustment for age and mean BP values. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that stiffening of large elastic artery is reflected more by ambulatory than office BP elevations, systolic BP being much more important than diastolic. Alterations of large elastic arteries function is related to structural wall changes. Functional and structural properties of middle‐size muscle arteries are independent of BP.

AB  -  1. Study name: ACEI/CCB versus ACEI/DIU combination antihypertensive therapy in Chinese hypertensive patients (ACvAD) 2. Medicine: Benazepril 10 mg / amlodipine besylate 5 mg fixed‐dose combination, benazepril 10 mg / hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg fixed‐dose combination. 3. Rationale: A meta‐analysis of 42 studies showed that the combination of two antihypertensive drugs is better than a single drug to control blood pressure [1]. Most patients with grade 2 or higher hypertension need two or more antihypertensive drugs to control blood pressure. Combined antihypertensive therapy can not only control blood pressure and improve patient compliance, but also reduce adverse drug reactions. For patients who have not received antihypertensive therapy and have high blood pressure levels, the guidelines recommend that combination therapy can be used in the initial treatment. The fixed‐dose combination can not only obtain the curative effect, but also can improve patient compliance by reducing the number of tablets [2]. Most hypertension guidelines, including the Chinese guidelines for hypertension, recommend the combination of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and calcium antagonists (CCB) or thiazide diuretics (DIU). However, whether the two combination treatments have similar antihypertensive effects in Chinese hypertensive patients still lack clinical trial evidence, especially when randomized controlled trials use dynamic or family blood pressure monitoring as the main evaluation method. This study will conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial in a large sample of Chinese hypertensive patients, by measuring office blood pressure, monitoring 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure and home blood pressure to compare the impact of benazepril 10 mg / amlodipine besylate 5 mg fixed‐dose combination and benazepril 10 mg / hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg fixed‐dose combination on office, 24‐hour, morning, daytime and nocturnal blood pressure. 4. Objective: The main goal of this study is to evaluate the decrease range of 24‐hour dynamic systolic blood pressure in the ACEI/CCB group compared with the ACEI/DIU group after 6 months antihypertensive treatment. The secondary goal is to compare decrease range of 24‐hour dynamic diastolic blood pressure, daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, night systolic and diastolic blood pressure, family systolic and diastolic blood pressure, office systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 6‐month follow‐up. 5. Study design: This study is a multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial with two arms (sample size is the same): ACEI/CCB and ACEI/DIU arm. 6. Study population: Screening of newly diagnosed grade 2 hypertensive patients over the age of 18 or patients who cannot control blood pressure by monotherapy. Patients who never taking antihypertensive drugs or stop taking antihypertensive drugs for more than 2 weeks, or receiving single‐drug antihypertensive therapy, systolic blood pressure 140‐179mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure 90‐109mmHg, entering 4weeks observation period before enrollment. During the observation period, all patients take benazepril 10 mg daily, and office follow‐up at 2 weeks and 4 weeks. If patients can take benazepril for 4 weeks continually, no adverse reaction, the mean systolic blood pressure of 6 office blood pressure readings is between 140 and 179mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 90‐109mmHg in 2 office follow‐ups, then can start group randomizing, using benazepril and switching to study medication. Regardless of whether the office blood pressure is in accordance with the enrollment conditions, monitoring family blood pressure for one week before randomizing, the blood pressure is measured twice every morning and night by an electronic sphygmomanometer. Exclusion criteria include: suspected or confirmed secondary hypertension; history of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke or dementia; other drugs that may affect blood pressure; liver function (ALT, AST, TBL) results ≥ Twice the upper limit, serum creatinine ≥1.5mg/dl (133μmol/L), urine routine protein (+) or higher; blood potassium>5.5mmol/L or <3.5mmol/L; history of gout or male blood uric acid ≥420μmol/L, female ≥360μmol/L; elderly nursing home patients; or patients who are participating in other clinical trials. 7. Randomization and treatment: Eligible patients should be monitored 24‐hour blood pressure before enrollment. Then randomly divided into two groups according to the center and whether receive antihypertensive treatment, taking benazepril 10 mg/amlodipine besylate 5mg fixed‐dose combination, 1 tablet once a day, or benazepril 10mg / hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg fixed‐dose combination, 1 tablet once a day. If the systolic/diastolic blood pressure is ≥140/90 mmHg during follow‐up, the dose can be increased to 2 tablets once a day. If the systolic /diastolic blood pressure continues ≥140/90mmHg, bisoprolol 5mg (1 tablet once a day) or doxazosin controlled‐release tablets 4mg (1 tablet once a day) or spironolactone 20mg (1 tablet once a day) can be added further. 8. Follow up: All eligible patients sign an informed consent form before entering the study. The Omron electronic sphygmomanometer is used to measure the sitting blood pressure in the clinic, and the medical history will be asked. Clinical examinations include dynamic blood pressure monitoring, home blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram, blood and urine routine, and biochemical tests. Patients will be followed up every month, measuring sitting blood pressure and asking about adverse events etc; using an automatic transmission electronic sphygmomanometer to monitor one‐week home blood pressure before each follow‐up; monitoring dynamic blood pressure, home blood pressure, electrocardiogram, blood and urine routine for 6 months after randomization. 9. Sample size estimation: The primary outcome is the 24‐hour dynamic systolic blood pressure reduction at 6‐month follow‐up compared with baseline in two groups. Assume that the difference between groups is 2.5mmHg, the standard deviation is 10mmHg, α=0.05, and the power is 80%. Each group needs 252 patients, if there is an additional 15% increase in cases, then each group should select at least 290 eligible patients and the total is 580 patients. The data will be analyzed by SAS software, and the t‐test is used to compare the two groups. 10. Timeline: Ethical review: November 2017; Enrollment: January‐February 2018; End of follow‐up: August 2018. At the same time, starting statistical analysis and publishing research results at appropriate domestic or international conferences. The main results will be published in international medical journals. 11. Organization: The Centre for Epidemiological Studies and Clinical Trials, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai, China.

AB  -  Objective: The newly‐introduced Mobil‐O‐Graph monitor has been validated against invasive and non‐invasive measurements of aortic systolic pressure (aSBP) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the general hypertensive population. However, the validity of Mobil‐O‐Graph‐derived measurements among patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) remains unclear.The aim of this study is to compare oscillometric measurements of aSBP, heart‐rate adjusted augmentation index (AIx75) and PWV obtained with the Mobil‐O‐Graph monitor (IEM, Germany) against tonometric measurements taken with the Sphygmocor device (ArtCor, Australia) in patients receiving long‐term PD. Design and method: A comparison study of 27 consecutive PD patients using the Sphygmocor‐derived aSBP, AIx75 and PWV as reference standard. After a 10‐min rest in the supine position, we applied the Mobil‐O‐Graph and Sphygmocor devices in a randomized order. Brachial BP recordings taken with a conventional sphygmomanometer were used to calibrate the Sphygmocor device. Results: Measurements of aSBP, AIx75 and PWV obtained with the Mobil‐O‐Graph device did not differ from relevant measurements taken with Sphygmocor (120.5 ± 18.2 vs 124.4 ± 19.0 mmHg, P = 0.438 for aoSBP, 27.0 ± 12.4 vs 24.5 ± 10.6%, P = 0.428 for AIx75 and 9.5 ± 2.1 vs 10.1 ± 3.1 m/sec, P = 0.397 for PWV). The slight difference in estimation of aSBP is possibly explained by the numerically higher brachial SBP values used for the calibration of Sphygmocor (131.0 ± 20.6 vs 134.5 ± 19.7 mmHg, P = 0.525). Mobil‐O‐Graph‐derived parameters were strongly and significantly correlated with paired measurements taken with Sphygmocor (r = 0.889, P < 0.001 for aSBP, r = 0.816, P < 0.001 for AIx75 and r = 0.794, P < 0.001 for PWV). Bland‐Altman plots showed no evidence of asymmetry and wide range of agreement between the two devices. Conclusions: This study suggests that oscillometric measurements of aSBP, AIx75 and PWV taken under static conditions with the Mobil‐O‐Graph monitor are closely related to tonometric measurements taken with the widely applied Sphygmocor device among patients on PD. The use of the Mobil‐O‐Graph monitor may facilitate the accurate determination of arterial stiffness indexes under ambulatory conditions in this population.

AB  -  Background/Aims: Overweight in adolescents is a global health problem. The prevalence of overweight among adolescents in West Java province was 7.5%. Overweight was caused by food intake, low physical activity, and adolescent behaviors. Overweight increased metabolic syndrome and non‐communicable diseases and morbidity. The study explored the effect of integrated interventions by diet, behavior, physical activity on overweight adolescents in junior high school in urban Bandung. Methods: The study design was pretest‐posttest randomized control trial among 88 overweight students. Students were grouped into different interventions, i.e. (1) diet, (2) physical activity, (3) integrated diet, behavior and physical activity, and (4) behavior. Data collected and measured were BMI, RLPP, and body weight by anthropometry. Blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometer. Nutritional intake was measured by food recall questionnaire. Data were analyzed by MANOVA by significance level p < 0.05. Results: By the end of the study, there were a decreased in food intake such as energy, carbohydrates, fat, and protein. The prevalence of obese was 27.5% and of overweight 72.5% at baseline. At endline, the prevalence of obese was 22.0%, overweight 76.9% and normal 1.1% (p = 0.054). The hypertension was 12.1% then decreased to 4.4% and 2.2% had normal status. Systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Interventions decreased body weight and systolic blood pressure, and improved nutritional status among adolescents.

AB  -  The anti‐hypertensive effects of atenolol (Tenormin) 50 mg, a potassium‐sparing diuretic (half‐strength Moduretic) comprising hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus 2.5 mg amiloride hydrochloride, and the 'free' combination of atenolol and diuretic were compared in elderly hypertensive patients aged 60‐79 years. After a four‐week run‐in period on placebo, patients were randomly assigned, in a double‐blind manner, to atenolol or diuretic treatment, each for four weeks. Thereafter patients were given the 'free' combination for a further four weeks and this treatment was continued for six months. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured after the patient had rested for five minutes supine and after two minutes standing. These blood pressure measurements were made at least 24 hours after the preceding dose using a Random Zero sphygmomanometer. Results from 26 of the 27 patients entered into the study showed an advantage for combination therapy combined with either atenolol or diuretic treatment alone. No significant difference was found between treatments in the frequency of supraventricular and ventricular ectopic beats occurring in six patients who underwent 24‐hour ambulatory ECG monitoring. However, ectopic activity was reduced in some patients during beta‐blocker treatment. Few adverse effects occurred with any treatment. Three patients withdrew during the placebo period and three withdrew while taking active treatment. This study has shown that the combination of atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride hydrochloride is an effective, safe, well‐tolerated antihypertensive drug regimen when used once daily in elderly hypertensive patients.

AB  -  Background: In this study, we compared two wrist blood pressure‐measuring devices, the Omron RX and the Nissei WS‐310, against a mercury manometer. Method: A total of 152 subjects attending an out‐patient hypertensive clinic were recruited from a randomized blood pressure survey, 87 patients (mean 44.4 + 14.5 years of age) being selected according to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/British Hypertension Society standards. Device validation was assessed through the use of sequential same‐arm readings compared with readings taken using a mercury sphygmomanometer by the two trained observers. Results: There were no differences between the observers and the monitors for diastolic readings (2.8 + 4.8 mmHg for the Omron and 4.2 + 6.4 mmHg for the Nissei) according to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation standards. The largest standard deviations ‐ 8.3 mmHg for the Omron and 8.8 mmHg for the Nissei, respectively were seen for systolic readings recorded by the observers and the monitors. According to the British Hypertension Society standards, the Omron achieved an A grade for diastolic readings and a B grade for systolic readings within 5 and 10 mmHg. The Nissei monitor achieved an A grade for diastolic readings and a B grade for systolic readings within 5 and 10 mmHg. Conclusion: Patients found the wrist oscillometric devices that we tested to be comfortable and easy to use. These devices are appropriate for measuring diastolic blood pressure according to the standards, but the reliability of both devices decreased when measuring systolic blood pressure. 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  -  A randomized double‐blind study was performed on a group of mild hypertensive patients (WHO class I) to compare the hemodynamic effects of pindolol and atenolol. Blood pressure (BP) was monitored with a mercury gauge sphygmomanometer, while cardiac function and peripheral arterial flows were measured by the noninvasive technique of bioelectric impedance. After a 2‐week washout period, patients with a diastolic BP greater than 95 mm Hg but less than 114 mm Hg were randomized into the pindolol (29 patients) or atenolol (28) treatment groups. Patients were treated with 1 of the 2 drugs in an incremental fashion for 12 weeks. Cardiovascular function was measured after the washout period and at the end of the 12‐week treatment period. Baseline hemodynamics were similar in both groups. The 2 drugs were equally effective in lowering both systolic and diastolic BP. Hemodynamically, pindolol lowered BP by decreasing total peripheral resistance (‐406 +/‐ 145 dynes.s.cm‐5) while atenolol decreased cardiac index (‐0.2 +/‐ 0.1 liters/min/m2) associated with a decrease in heart rate (‐12 +/‐ 2 beats/min). Regarding peripheral vascular beds, pindolol lowered arm vascular resistance (‐198 +/‐ 72 mm Hg/liter/min) and leg vascular resistance (‐73 +/‐ 25 mm Hg/liter/min), especially when subjects who did not respond to pindolol were excluded from the analysis. Both arm (5.5 +/‐ 5.4% increase above baseline) and leg (1.2 +/‐ 4.4% increase above baseline) arterial flow indexes were maintained with pindolol. Conversely, atenolol decreased the arm arterial flow index (‐9,8 +/‐ 5.6% decrease below baseline), but not significantly and with no change in resistance (+54 +/‐ 62 mm Hg/liter/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  -  INTERVENTION: The study adopts a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) design involving a total of 60 site communities with 12 in the control arm and 48 in the intervention arm. The control arm maintains existing hypertension patient management; while the intervention arms, personalized hypertension management (PHMA). Project evaluation applies to all arms using the same data collection methods and by the same field data collectors. And detailed intervention in intervention arms varies from patient to patient due to the personalized approach. So, the uneven distribution of site communities between the control and intervention arms were designed to enable detection of potential differences between the control arm and three to four main subgroups with different intervention ingredients in the intervention arm. The analysis and reporting of the trial will be in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines. The overall goal of PHMA is to prevent hypertension from harming the health of the patient under concern. This goal is reached by eight objective behaviors including: 1. Attending and responding to project messages/contacts 2. Performing self‐monitoring and reporting 3. Modifying unhealthy diet habits/practices 4. Maintaining adequate physical exercise/activities 5. Containing tobacco and alcohol consumption 6. Addressing emotion and sleep problems 7. Using clinical checkups and treatment 8. Facilitating family engagement and support. These objective behaviors are promoted through two intervention stages and four intervention measures. The four intervention measures are: support for self‐monitoring (I1), perso CONDITION: Hypertension ; Circulatory System ; Hypertension PRIMARY OUTCOME: Systolic BP/Diastolic BP measured using mercury sphygmomanometer at baseline and every 12 months after baseline for 5 years SECONDARY OUTCOME: ; 1. Quality of life; 2. Occurrence of hypertension‐related complications (such as cerebral hemorrhage, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction); 3. Healthcare utilization; 4. Scores of objective behaviors; All secondary outcome measures will be measured using structured questionnaires at baseline and every 12 months after baseline for 5 years; INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Aged =18 years 2. Living in the selected villages for =6 months/year 3. Diagnosed with hypertension

AB  -  Background. Automatic noninvasive blood pressure measuring devices should be independently validated prior to marketing by using standard guidelines such as those published by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and British Hypertension Society. Objective. To assess a new noninvasive oscillometric automatic home blood pressure (Omron HEM‐737 IntelliSense; Omron Healthcare Inc., Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA). Methods. We compared the device's measurements with mercury column measurements for 90 subjects (270 measurements). In addition to calculation of the limits of agreement for the device versus observers, we also determined the impacts of age, level of blood pressure, body mass, and arm size on the levels of agreement. Results. Observers showed that close agreement was attained, with mean differences of 0.42 + 3.65 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 0.37 + 3.59 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. The proportions of values agreeing to within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg were 88, 99, and 100% for systolic and 86, 100, and 100% for diastolic blood pressure for the two observers. The observer‐device disagreement was 0.76 + 6.55 mmHg for systolic and 1.0 + 5.5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. The proportions of values agreeing to within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg were 71, 93, and 97% for systolic and 77, 96, and 98% for diastolic blood pressure for the observers and device. Conclusions. The Omron HEM‐737 IntelliSense satisfied the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation's criteria for a general adult population across large ranges of age, blood pressure, body mass, and arm circumference. These findings support the use of this recorder for out‐of‐office self‐monitoring of blood pressure.

AB  -  Introduction: We already developed a telemedicine system using a cellular phone and internet web site to monitor changes in blood pressure and pulse rate in patients at home (Nakamoto et al., Hypertension 42: 442â€"3, 2003). Using this system, we have conducted the blood pressure control crossover study with amlodipine vs. nifedipine CR. Methods: Patients who were not taking an anti‐hypertensive ca‐antagonist other than amlodipine (A) or nifedipine CR (N) were eligible to enter this study. The patients in the first group (n 11) started A 2.5 mg/day. Doses of A were increased to achieve home blood pressure less than 135 / 85 mmHg to the extent of 7.5 mg/day. If necessary, atenolol was added. After achieving the target blood pressure, home blood pressure was monitored for more than 6 weeks and then A was changed to N. Home blood pressure monitoring was continued for more than 6 weeks after changing medication. The patients in second group (n 9) took N firstly, and then changed to A. The alternative doses were as follows; A 2.5 mg/day N 20 mg/day, A 5.0 mg/day N 40mg/day, A 7.5 mg/day N 60 mg/day. Blood pressure was checked at least twice a day, in the morning within 1 hour after wake‐up and in the evening before going to bed. Data of blood pressure and pulse rate were measured by automatic sphygmomanometer and were directly collected by i‐converter. All data including the time of measurement were directly sent and accumulated in the main server constructed in NTT DoCoMo data center through cellular phone operated by i‐converter. We could download data to CSV file like Excel and analyze them easily. Results: The mean of morning blood pressure in each period of medicine was significantly decreased in N period ( 133.0 1.1 / 78.1 1.1 mmHg (A) vs. 130.0 0.9 / 77.9 1.0 mmHg (N), p 0.05 ). The mean of morning pulse rate significantly increased in N period ( 68.4 1.2 beats / min (A) vs. 70.5 1.3 beats / min (N), p 0.05 ).Conclusion: The blood pressure reduction effect of nifedipine CR is stronger than that of amlodipine. Also, nifedipine CR increases pulse rate at our alternative dose setting. In this study, we have collected more data of home blood pressure in the quality and quantity than the previous studies through our telemedicine system. We also reduced the effort of data analysis with this system. (59th Annual Fall Conference and Scientific Sessions of the Council for High Blood Pressure Research)

AB  -  Background: Blood pressure control plays an integral role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Aside from lifestyle changes, pharmacotherapy is the physician's most effective method of lowering blood pressure. We hypothesize that patient involvement in a program centered on frequent self measurement of blood pressures and frequent reporting via telemedicine will bring about changes in physician prescribing habits. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of a telemedicine trial of 241 patients with uncontrolled hypertension (BP>150/90 mmHg). Patient from two large medical centers were recruited and randomized to usual care (control group‐C, N=122) or Telemedicine with usual care (T, N=120). The T group was provided a digital sphygmomanometer and training, along with CVD risk reduction counseling. They were instructed to report their BP, HR, weight, steps/day, and tobacco use twice weekly for 6 months. All patients had baseline and 6‐month follow‐up visits. Monthly reports on blood pressure and treatment guidelines were provided to both the patient and physician in the T group. At the end of the study, patients' anti‐hypertensive medications were compared to their baseline therapy. Results: The average age of patients was 59+/‐13 years; the proportion of African Americans was 80%; initial average blood pressure was 155.9+/‐13.7/ 88.9+/‐11.2. At baseline, 56.8% of patients were taking between 1‐2 anti‐hypertensives. There was a statistically significant change in the number of anti‐hypertensive medications prescribed to patients in the Telemedicine group ( 2.20+/‐1.20 to 2.34+/‐1.15, p=0.004), but not in the control group (1.95+/‐1.02 to 1.91+/‐1.21, p=0.468). Multivariate analysis did not show any difference in results with respect to age, ethnicity, education, or income. Conclusion: Patients in the telemedicine group were more likely to be prescribed more anti‐hypertensive medications during the study. This may indicate that patient involvement in self‐reporting via telemedicine changes the information available to the physician in such a way that leads to more appropriate and effective pharmacotherapy, better blood pressure control, and overall reduction in cardiovascular risk.

AB  -  Objective: To review the safety and efficacy of the very‐low‐dose combination of perindopril 2 mg and indapamide 0.625 mg (Per2/Ind0.625) in essential hypertension, in relation to blood pressure control and target‐organ damage. Study selection: We included in this review several double‐blind, randomized studies in hypertensive patients, including five main studies from the European registration file and two clinical trials on regression of target‐organ damage [large artery stiffness: the Preterax in Regression of Arterial Stiffness in a Controlled Double‐Blind Study (REASON); microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes: the Preterax in Albuminuria Regression (PREMIER) study]. Main outcome measures: Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures measured at trough with a mercury sphygmomanometer, an automatic device (OMRON), and 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM). Arterial stiffness, assessed from pulse wave velocity measurement and augmentation index (REASON study). Microalbuminuria (PREMIER study). Results: The Per2/Ind0.625 combination was selected from the dose‐finding studies. Twelve weeks after the participants were assigned to study groups, the reductions in SBP, measured with an OMRON device, were 12.3 ± 15.0 mmHg with Per2/Ind0.625, 8.0 ± 16.5 mmHg with perindopril 2 mg (P = 0.001), 9.4 ± 14.3 mmHg with indapamide 0.625 mg (P = 0.023) and 2.1 ± 16.8 mmHg with placebo (P < 0.001) (mean ± SD; all P values are for comparisons with Per2/Ind0.625). The reductions in DBP were 6.8 ± 9.2 mmHg, 5.0 ± 9.5 mmHg (P = 0.02), 4.7 ± 8.2 mmHg (P = 0.004) and 2.4 ± 9.6 mmHg (P < 0.001 ) in the Per2/Ind0.625, perindopril 2 mg, indapamide 0.625 mg and placebo groups, respectively. During the long‐term study, among 235 patients who achieved initial blood pressure normalization with the fixed combination, 79.8% sustained their normalized status over 1 year, with no significant difference regarding safety criteria. During the REASON study, Per/Ind reduced pulse wave velocity to a similar extent as atenolol, and augmentation index to a greater extent. During the PREMIER study, Per/Ind reduced microalbuminuria to a greater extent than did enalapril. Conclusions: The proven efficacy on blood pressure and regression of target‐organ damage with a good safety profile confirm that the new fixed‐low‐dose combination Per2/Ind0.625 is a valuable option in the first‐line treatment of hypertension. © 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  -  The antihypertensive activity of lercanidipine was compared with that of amlodipine in a randomized, active‐controlled, double‐blind, crossover study in patients with mild‐to‐moderate essential hypertension. After a 2‐week washout period and a 3‐week placebo run‐in period, 20 patients were treated with either lercanidipine 20 mg or amlodipine 10 mg once daily for 4 weeks. Subsequently, after 2 weeks of placebo washout, patients underwent another 4‐ week period of the alternative treatment. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured before and at the end of each treatment period by means of a standard sphygmomanometer and 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The ABPM profiles were super‐imposable and demonstrated a delayed peak effect of both drugs. After 4 weeks of active treatment, lercanidipine‐ treated patients had significant decreases (P < 0.01) in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (20.31 mm Hg and 13.13 mm Hg, respectively) that were greater, although not significantly greater, than those observed in the amlodipine group (13.25 mm Hg [P < 0.05] and 10.45 mm Hg [P < 0.05], respectively). Heart rate did not change significantly. After the first 4 weeks, 86% and 56% of patients in the lercanidipine and amlodipine groups, respectively, responded to treatment, whereas 67% and 86%, respectively, responded after the second 4‐week treatment period. Results of this study suggest that lercanidipine was as effective as amlodipine in lowering SBP and DBP in patients with mild‐to‐moderate essential hypertension. Both drugs are known to exhibit a good safety profile; however, because of the limited sample size, safety claims could not be made.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test chymase inhibitory traditional Japanese food (Japanese Water Pepper, JWP) intake in salt‐induced hypertensive mouse model and in human. // DESIGN AND METHOD: Salt‐dependent hypertension model using 8 weeks age of wild type mice was established giving 2% NaCl drinking water. This model shows chronic moderate hypertension (AJP 2015). Our extensive food extract survey for inhibition of human chymase revealed that JWP possessed human chymase inhibitory effect in vitro. Antihypertensive effect of orally given dried and powdered JWP was examined in above model in vivo. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure post 12 week salt loading in placebo treated group showed significant increase (146/103 mmHg) compared to the starting point at 8 weeks (111/73 mmHg), whereas those in the treated group with JWP (n = 15) showed no significant increase (129/83 mmHg and 748/min) and were equivalent to those in non‐salt loading control group except heart rate (n = 20, 124/82 mmHg). // RESULTS: Secondarily, a prospective double blind randomized placebo control clinical trial was performed using dried powered JWP. Mild to moderate hypertensives (n = 36) without taking any antihypertensive drug were recruited and randomly divided into three groups: placebo (n = 13), orally taking dried and powdered JWP 400 (n = 13) or 800 mg/day (n = 13) groups for 12 weeks after at least 2 weeks observation period. Home blood pressure was monitored by an automatic data registering sphygmomanometer in the morning as well as evening. Morning and evening systolic blood pressure of JWP group showed significant reduction before and after the intake of JWP (p < 0.001) and compared to those of control group (p < 0.01). Heart rate of three groups did not change significantly. // CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that chymase inhibition by JWP contributed to anti‐hypertensive effect in high salt‐loading hypertensive mouse model and in human. JWP will be applicable to salt‐induced hypertension in human.

AB  -  Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate by ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) the 24 hours antihypertensive efficacy of the fixed combination therapy, valsartan 80 mg+hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (V+H), once daily, after 6 weeks of treatment, in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Study design: It was a French, multicenter, double blind, randomized trial in parallel groups comparing V+H and placebo. After an initial two weeks placebo period, patients were assigned to receive either V+H or placebo for six weeks. Were eligible those with clinical arterial blood pressure, measured by sphygmomanometer, between 160/95 and 209/114 mmHg after monotherapy. A 26 hours ABPM, with Spacelabs 90207, was done at J0 and J42 (one measurement every 15 minutes, in day time and at night). Responders were defined as a fall in day diastolic blood pressure>5 mmHg and/or day diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg with ABPM. Results: 123 of the 138 randomized patients had two interpretative measurements. Their average age was 59+10 years. 57% (78) of them were males and their average ABPM before treatment was 143+15/88+11 mmHg. With V+H, the reduction of the systolic and the diastolic blood pressure measured by ABPM, was significally more important than with placebo (SBP: ‐15.4+10.9 mmHg versus ‐0.6+7.7 mmHg, p<0.001; DBP: ‐9.1+7 mmHg versus ‐0.4+5.4 mmHg, p<0.001). Pulse pressure (PP) was also significally reduced with the combination therapy V+H, but it was not modified with placebo (‐6.3+5.5 mmHg versus ‐0.2+4.1 mmHg, p<0.001). ABPM responder rate was 73% with V+H versus 24% with placebo (p<0.001). Trough/peak ratio was 80.3% for systolic blood pressure and 57.3% for diastolic blood pressure. The combination V+H was as well tolerated as placebo. Conclusion: The fixed combination V+H used for treatment of hypertension, after failure of monotherapy, is very effective in reducing pulse pressure, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, over 24 hours, homogeneously, and is as well tolerated as placebo.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: Our study will comprise a double‐blind parallel randomised placebo‐controlled trial of 12 weeks duration investigating the effect of Kyolic aged garlic extract on gut microbiota, inflammatory markers, and cognitive function in patients with high blood pressure. The active treatment group will be allocated to two daily capsules of aged garlic extract (1.2 g Kyolic Reserve, 1.2 mg S‐allylcysteine). Compliance will be assessed by return of trial capsules, as well as diary entries. CONDITION: hypertension PRIMARY OUTCOME: Central hemodynamic measures ; Pulse Wave velocity (PWV)is a strong predictor of cardiovascular morbidity, and is most reliably measured by a comparison of carotid to femoral pulse wave. The SphygmoCor Xcel device (Atcor Medical) provides the gold standard validated instrument. Clinical blood pressure ; A trained research assistant will use a validated and calibrated digital sphygmomanometer with appropriate sized cuffs. The display of the sphygmomanometer is to be positioned away from the patient to assure blinding to the BP readings. BP measurement to be taken with patient in seated position with arm supported at heart level, after 5 min rest, after abstinence from food, nutritional supplements, caffeinated beverages, and smoking for a minimum of 2 hours prior to BP measurement at approximately the same time/day of the week. BP will be recorded as three serial measurements at intervals of 30 seconds. The mean of the three BP measurements will be used in the analysis. Stool test ; Enrolled patients will be provided with a test kit from Genova (www.gtx.com, USA) via Nutripath, Melbourne, Australia at their first appointment for baseline testing, and will be instructed to collect a stool sample as close as possible to their baseline appointment and sent the kit to Genova for a Microbial Ecological Profile (GI Effects Stool Profile), providing a comprehensive profile of commensal bacterial species in colony‐forming‐units (CFU)/g stool by PCR‐DNA analysis. PCR‐DNA analysis offers a more accurate result than standard culturing technologies. The report will be used to calculate Chaos diversity, Shannon diversity index, and Firmicute/Bacteroides ratio and relevant correlations. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Cognitive function testing ; Patients will undergo the Swinburne University Computerised Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB) test in the NIIM cognitive function labs. The SUCCAB test consists of eight computer‐based tasks assessing speed and accuracy, shown to correlate to cognitive decline through ageing, with a difference in 60 milliseconds in speed correlating to about 10 years of ageing. ; Our research team has been collaborating closely with the ‘inventor’ of the computerised test in a number of projects, and NIIM has recently built the laboratory facilities to undertake the testing in a controlled environment. ; Testing takes about 30 minutes including a practice session of about 10 minutes for the participant to familiarise themselves with the equipment and the task battery. Inflammatory markers ; The research assistant, trained in phlebotomy, will take a fasted blood sample for testing of inflammatory markers TNF‐alpha and interleukin‐6 or interleukin‐10. ; INCLUSION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria ‐ Essential hypertension: Mean systolic SBP >=140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >=90 mm Hg to be confirmed under trial conditions at the screening appointment (at screening mean DBP of >=88 / SBP >=135 mm Hg will be included) ‐ Either not on blood pressure medication, or on established plan of blood pressure medication (one or more classes) for at least 2 months ‐ The patient’s doctor is not planning to change current treatment during the 3 month trial ‐ Able to give informed consent

AB  -  INTERVENTION: The intervention program will start from hospital via an individualised discharge education provided by the patient’s in‐charge nurse and the medical specialist (1st stage of intervention). After patients are discharged, in addition to the usual follow‐up in the outpatient clinic of hospital, they will be referred to the nearest Community Health Service Centre to receive 6 months follow‐up intervention provided by general practitioners (GPs) and community nurses (2nd stage of intervention). Health professionals from both hospital and community health service centres will work in a collaborative way to implement the post‐discharge interventions. Stage 1: Interventions at hospital: 1. Individualised discharge education: 1.1. Patients will be given two face‐to‐face individualised health education sessions specific to diabetic patients with hypertension by the in‐charge nurse, with one session 3 days prior to discharge and one on day of discharge. The health education includes health behaviour education, disease‐associated education and medication education with 15 minutes for each session. A geriatrics conditions screening will also be undertaken using the widely recognised evidence‐based screening tool “Fulmer Spices Comprehensive Assessment Tool for Older Adults” (Aronow et al., 2014). Education on preventing and managing geriatric conditions will be provided by the in‐charge nurse based on the finding from the screening. 1.2. Patients will be asked to establish lifestyle modification goals and develop personal action plans with the in‐charge nurse. Patients will be provided an “Intervention diary‐patient version” (refer to Additional file 1 in ANZCTR registration record) to document their lifestyle modification goals, personal action plans, progress towards the goals, medication adherence, adverse events and unplanned hospital admission/ the use of emergency care service. 1.3. Patients will be asked to discuss and establish their diet plan with the in‐charge nurse. Diet plan will be recorded in “intervention diary‐patient version”. 1.4. Prior to discharge, patients will be given an individualized medication treatment plan by the medical specialist. Individualized medication treatment will be recorded in the “intervention diary‐patient version”. 1.5. When patients are discharged from hospital, they will be referred to the community health service centers by the in‐charge nurse for regular follow up over 6 months. In addition, an “Intervention record‐community nurse and GP version” (refer to Additional file 2 in ANZCTR registration record) will be sent to the community nurse by the in‐charge nurse on discharge to record required post‐discharge interventions and outcomes. 1.6. Discharge planning and referral 1.6.1 The in‐charge nurse at the hospital will contact the GP and nurse in community health service centers to fill in the two‐way referral letter for patients, and help patients to contact the nearby community health service centers for follow up visit. Patients will be advised the community health service centers they referred to, and the name and contacts of GP/nurse in community health service centers. 1.6.2 Data in relation to the patient’s demographic information, pharmacotherapy history, and other clinical information will be sent to the community nurse by the in‐charge nurse on discharge. 1.6.3 Three copies of two‐way referral letter will be printed and delivered to the doctor/nurse in hospital,patient and GP/nurse at community health service centers in order to establish the collaboration among them. 1.6.4 Patients will take the referral letter and discharge abstract to the community health service centers for the follow up visit. 1.6.5 The in‐charge nurse will keep track of the patient’s referral progress through contact with the patients and community nurses, and ensure patients are referred to the community health service center. Stage 2: Regular follow up interventions over 6 months at community health service centers: 1. Fortnightly phone call: Patients will receive a fortnightly phone call at home from the community nurse to monitor their progress towards setting goals and medication adherence. The approximate duration of follow‐up phone calls at each time will be 10 minutes. 2. Monthly community health service centers visit: Patients will be asked to visit the community nurse and GP at the community health service centers every month for follow up visits. The approximate duration of follow‐up visit at each time will be 30 minutes. 2.1 Patients will receive blood pressure measurement every month by the community nurse. 2.2 Patients will receive a review and assessment from the community nurse on their adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations, and their progress toward lifestyle modification goals. The diet management of patients will follow the guideline of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). 2.3 Patients will receive reinforced health CONDITION: Hypertension Type II diabetes PRIMARY OUTCOME: systolic blood pressure at six months follow‐up adjusted for baseline value. It will be assessed by automatic sphygmomanometer. SECONDARY OUTCOME: HbA1c recorded from medical records of patients, with baseline value adjusted Hypertension and diabetes‐related health knowledge score measured by the combination of Hypertension Knowledge Level Scale (HK‐LS) and Diabetes Knowledge Questionnaire (DKQ), with baseline value adjusted.

AB  -  Introduction. Infertility constitutes the cause for about 16.6% of patients seeking consultations at the primary healthcare level. Male factor infertility accounts for about 50% of all infertility problems. Of this percentage seminal fluid abnormality of unknown cause is common, occurring in up to 60% of males with unexplained, this type of infertility. Although some subjects with seminal fluid defects have fathered children those with infertility have long posed a major therapeutic challenge. The rationale for using the various hormonal and non‐hormonal drugs currently available is, at best, empirical as most of the efficacy trials conducted yielded conflicting results. Although assisted fertilization techniques have now increased the number of therapeutic options available to couples with infertility problems there is still a very serious limitation in the access to the new technology, especially in low‐income countries. Besides, there are additional concerns regarding the possible untoward effects. These lingering problems underscore the need for continuing to search for other effective treatment options that will not only be cheaper and more accessible but also less complicated and non‐invasive. The current study was occasioned by our previous, independent observations (albeit fortuitous) of normalization of seminal fluid parameters as well as spouse pregnancies in two men with long‐standing, idiopathic azoospermia. The common factor between the two men was treatment with low‐dose (2.5mg per day) Lisinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or ACEI prescribed for the concomitant hypertension. A review of the available literature on the efficacy studies of various types of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on sperm count and quality revealed a near‐consistent finding of improvement in animal studies. However, methodological flaws have rendered the results in the very scanty human studies extremely difficult to interpret. The current study design was intentionally rigorous; efforts having been consciously made to control for most known confounding factors as far as was possible. Methods. The study was conducted at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu. A prior approval of the detailed study protocol was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the same hospital. Each of the patients gave informed consent before enrollment into the study. The investigation was a longitudinal, randomized, double‐blind and placebo‐controlled clinical trial with a crossover design. The subjects for this investigation were selected from a volunteer pool of male patients attending the fertility clinic of University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu. At the time of enrollment each subject was given explicit information about the study with respect to the intention, the expectations from him, the procedure, the planned duration of the investigation, and the potential adverse reactions that could occur from the intended medication. The recruitment of patients took place from March 1998 to September 2001 while the actual study lasted for five years, from January 2002 to December 2006. In strict compliance with the protocol requirement all the participants entered the study within 7 days of starting the onset and they were being followed up concurrently. Throughout the period of the clinical trial the patients mandated to continue their different "background" fertility medications in the same doses as they were being prescribed by their attending fertility physicians. The rationale for this was to avoid the unethical situation whereby a group taking placebo would be denied medication. Conceited efforts were made to exclude subjects with any background medication that had a documented interaction with lisinopril. The apparent superfluity of combining a crossover design (which provides for a within‐subjects control) with a separate (between‐subjects) control was deliberate. That was done in an effort to control, in one swoop, for two potentially confounding factors; viz., the possible effect on the study out‐come of the concurrent background medications, and the possible event of a random, seasonal variation in human seminal fluid characteristics. Throughout the whole period of the study the investigators kept in close touch with the patients by phone calls in order to continually motivate them, remind them of scheduled appointment dates, monitor compliance and detect any possible incidence of adverse drug effect. Assessment of compliance to the medications: Compliance to the medications was monitored by a combination of oral interviews and physical inspection of medication containers for pill counting. These were done at every scheduled visit, through sporadic phone calls and by unscheduled home visits. The level of compliance of each patient was expressed in percent (%) and calculated as the actual number of doses taken/the expected number of doses multiplied by 100 for the period under consideration. Adverse events monitoring: The patients were encouraged to report every event promptly by phone to one of the authors (NOG), no matter however minor and not minding whether related to lisinopril or not. Entries were promptly made and then one of the physicians in the team was detailed to make proper assessment of every reported case and make recommendations with respect to further management and/or the need or otherwise for withdrawal of the patient from the trial. Medical interventions, where needed, were given without any cost to the patients. In addition, the serum potassium concentrations and blood pressures (supine and erect) were measured in every patient at each of the scheduled visits in furtherance of the adverse events monitoring. Clinical measurements: Blood pressure measurements were done with mercury sphygmomanometers fitted with adult‐size cuffs (Accoson, England) while korotcoffs I and V were used for systolic and diastolic blood pressures respectively. This was because these had given more concordant results among the team members than the traditional I and IV Korotcoffs. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of each patient was calculated using the conventional formula; MAP = [(2 x diastolic) + systolic] divided by 3. Laboratory measurements: Seminal fluid for analysis was each time collected by self‐masturbation in a room close to the laboratory and submitted promptly to the analysts. The collected semen specimens were incubated at 37 degrees Centigrade and allowed to stand for 1 hour in order to thaw. The pipette method was used for the ejaculate volume while microscopic methods were used for the total sperm cell count, the percentage of sperm cell motility and the percentage of abnormal sperm cell morphology in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Serum potassium levels were estimated using the flame photo‐metric method as described by Davidson and Henry. The latter was a safeguard against hyperkalemia, a well documented, severe side effect of ACEI therapy. Statistical analysis: The statistical analysis was done with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16 (SPSS ‐ 16) software. All the data analyses were performed on the basis of the intention‐to‐treat in which last observations after the baseline were carried forward to end point. Prior to the analysis all the parameter data were examined for distributional patterns using the Shapiro‐Wilk Normality test. All the seminal fluid data as well as the serum potassium values were found to be skewed and so were normalized with logarithmic transformations. Two‐group comparisons were performed using the unpaired Student's t‐tests while proportions were compared using the Fisher's Exact tests. The data from longitudinally measured out‐come parameters were analyzed using two‐way repeated measures (mixed model) analysis of variance (mixed model ANOVA). Bonferroni's post‐hoc multiple comparison tests were run wherever a statistically significant difference was found (at p < 0.05) in either the within‐subjects means, the between‐subjects means or the interaction. The post‐hoc tests were done in order to explore further the patterns of within‐subjects parameter changes with the duration of treatment in both groups. The unwanted events reported during treatment with lisinopril and during placebo treatment were compared for statistical significance with the Koch's adaptation of Wilcoxon‐Mann‐Whitney‐ rank‐sum test.

AB  -  The effect of captopril 25 to 50 mg twice on 24 h blood pressures was compared with placebo in 14 patients with essential hypertension. Captopril was started in a dose of 25 mg b.d. in all patients. This dose was increased to 50 mg b.d. in those patients whose blood pressure was not normalized after 4 weeks (group II, n = 5), while in the others the same dose was continued (group I, n = 9). Blood pressure was measured at the end of the placebo period and after 8 weeks captopril, both in the office with a random zero sphygmomanometer and ambulant at home with a portable automated non‐invasive blood pressure measuring device (ICR). In comparing the ICR measurements with those made with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer good agreement between the two methods for both diastolic (r = 0.94, n = 110) and sytolic (r = 0.96, n = 110) blood pressure was found. In group I office blood pressures (mean + or ‐ s.e.m.) decreased fronm 166 + or ‐ 7/100 + or ‐ 3 mm Hg to 144 + or ‐ 4/87 + or ‐ 2 mm Hg (P<0.001). In group II these reductions were from 165 + or ‐ 7/104 + or ‐ 2 mmHg to 152 + or ‐ 5/90 + or ‐ 4 mmHg (P<0.05). During ambulatory monitoring, blood pressure was shown to have a circadian rhythm both on placebo and on captopril. Captopril 25 mg b.d. lowered blood pressure throughout the 24 h observation period, although these reductions were smaller at night than during the day. In group II comparable effects of captopril 50 mg b.d. were demonstrated. Captopril 25 to 50 mg twice daily adequately controls blood pressure in most patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved.

AB  -  1. Study name: Amlodipine Prevents Morning Blood Pressure Surge Study (ARMORS) 2. Study drugs: amlodipine (Norvasc®) and nifedipine GITS (Adalat®) 3. Rationale: Previous meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that the long acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine (Norvasc®), compared with other antihypertensive drugs, provides more protection against stroke. The benefit of amlodipine against stroke is approximately 10% greater than diuretics/β‐blockers, and 20% greater than angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Of all the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, only amlodipine provides protection against myocardial infarction similar as angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and β‐blockers, and more than angiotensin receptor blockers. The benefit of amlodipine in the prevention of stroke might be attributable to its 24‐h blood pressure control. 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure is more predictive of cardiovascular events than clinic pressure measured in doctor's office. The smoother the 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure control, the lower the risk of target organ damage. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure show a circadian rhythm with a nocturnal blood pressure fall and a morning blood pressure surge. The incidence of cardiovascular complications of hypertension, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, is higher in the early morning hours than the rest of the day. Several previous studies have demonstrated that an exaggerated morning blood pressure surge is associated with the incidence of stoke and with cardiovascular structural remodeling. Moreover, non‐dipping of blood pressure at night (non‐dipper, nighttime blood pressure fall less than 10%) is prevalent and is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular event. In a recent study of controlled hypertensive patients, the prevalence of non‐dipping of blood pressure at night was 62%. In our JingNing population study, we found that Chinese had a higher nighttime diastolic blood pressure than White populations, and the prevalence of isolated nocturnal hypertension was 10.9%. Patients with isolated nocturnal hypertension compared with normotensive subjects had an increased arterial stiffness. Thus, a preferable antihypertensive drug should not only reduce the 24‐h mean level of blood pressure, but should also effectively control morning blood pressure surge and reduce nighttime blood pressure. At present, there are two mechanisms of long‐acting antihypertensive agents. One is that the compound itself has a long half life time and hence shows a long term effect. Another is that the efficacy of a short‐acting drug is elongated by using a slow release or a controlled release (such as GITS) technique. However, the latter mechanism may vary between individuals because of the difference in the gastrointestinal function. Therefore, a long‐acting compound should be more reliable in the maintenance of long term efficacy than slow release or controlled release agents. In the class of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, amlodipine is a long‐acting compound because of a long half life time (up to 50 hours), and nifedipine GITS uses a controlled release technique. Several recent studies compared 24‐h blood pressure lowering effect of these 2 drugs, but produced inconsistent results. At least one study suggested that amlodipine may prevent morning blood pressure rise more effectively than nifedipine GITS. However, other studies demonstrated similar effect on morning blood pressure control of these 2 drugs. The inconsistency might be attributable to a chance finding, because of the small sample size (less than 100). Therefore, a randomized controlled trial with a larger sample size is required to compare these 2 dihydropyridines in the blood pressure control over 24 hours in general and during early morning hours and at night in particular. 4. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that amlodipine compared with nifedipine GITS has a stronger effect in preventing morning blood pressure surge (4 am to 8 am) in mild to moderate hypertensive patients. The secondary objective of the study is to compare the effects of amlodipine and nifedipine GITS in reducing nighttime blood pressure (10 pm to 4 am) in patients with a decreased nocturnal blood pressure fall. 5. Study design: The present study is designed as a randomized, actively controlled, multi‐centre parallel group trial (phase Ⅳ) with two equally sized treatment groups: amlodipine and nifedipine GITS. 6. Study population: In 20 research‐oriented university hospitals in China and in a pre‐defined timeframe, 500 patients will be considered for inclusion into the present study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 7. Randomization and treatment: After stratification for centre, 500 eligible patients will be randomized into 2 groups. 250 will receive amlodipine 5 mg per day, and 250 will receive nifedipine GITS 30 mg per day. At 4 weeks of follow‐up, the drug dosage per day may increase to 10 mg of amlodipine and 60 mg of nifedipine GITS, if blood pressure measured in doctor's office cannot be controlled to a level below 140/90 mm Hg. If there were no compelling indication, no other antihypertensive drug is allowed during the 2‐month trial. All antihypertensive medication should be taken before breakfast from 6‐8 clock in the morning. 8. Follow up: All patients should give written informed consent at entry into the present study. In addition to 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, patients should also undergo a questionnaire survey and clinical measurements including clinic blood pressure. Patients should be followed up in normal working hours in the morning or in the afternoon. The precise follow‐up time of the day should be recorded. At each follow‐up visit, the responsible physician should measure a patient's blood pressure and pulse rate, and collect information on the use of medications, serious adverse events, adverse events and cardiovascular complications. At 4 and 8 weeks of follow‐up, 24‐h and 48‐h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be performed, respectively. When 48‐h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is performed at 8 weeks of follow‐up, the patient should not take any antihypertensive medication on the second day of monitoring. Only validated blood pressure monitors (SpaceLabs 90207 and 90217) will be used. Before each ambulatory blood pressure measurement, blood pressure monitors will be set up in a standardized way. A cuff of proper size should be secured to the left arm of the patient. Before the commencement of ambulatory blood pressure measurement, blood pressure will be measured twice using mercury sphygmomanometer. Immediately after these 2 measurements, blood pressure will be measured twice manually with the monitor. Then, blood pressure will be measured automatically according to predefined time intervals of the blood pressure monitor (every 20 minutes from 8 am to 10 pm and every 30 minutes from 10 pm to 8 am). At the end of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, data will be transferred to a computer program. The same size cuff and the same arm should be used for all 3 ambulatory measurements for a patient. On the monitoring day, the patient should record the time to go to bed and to get up, the use of medications, and physical activity. 9. Potential difficulties: During the study, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may fail because of less than 20 readings during the whole day, less than 10 readings in the daytime or less than 5 readings at night. These failed measurements will have to be repeated. 10. Sample size estimation and statistical analysis: It is projected that the standard deviation of morning blood pressure in the enrolled hypertensive patients is 12 mm Hg, and amlodipine, compared with nifedipine GITS, reduces morning blood pressure at 4 months of follow‐up by 4 mm Hg. If α=0.05 and power=90%, the study will require a sample size of 190 hypertensive patients per group to detect the projected difference in the morning blood pressure (4 am‐8 am). After accounting for 5% of drop out rate and 20% patients on add‐on therapy, the sample size for each group is 250. Thus the number of required subject for the whole trial is 500. The trial will mainly compare the amlodipine with nifedipine GITS group in the changes of morning blood pressure (4 am‐8 am, about 8 blood pressure readings) and nighttime blood pressure (10 pm‐4 am) at 4 and 8 weeks from baseline. The student t test will be used and 95% confidence interval of the differences between the 2 groups will be computed. In addition, an adjusted analysis (ANOVA) will also be performed while accounting for major baseline characteristics. 11. Timeline: The trial will start from October 2009, 500 eligible patients would be randomized and followed up for 2 months. Database construction and statistical analysis will take 3 months. The trial will be published at the international congresses and in the English and Chinese literature in 2013. 12. Organization: The principal investigator will be Professor Jiguang Wang from the Centre for Epidemiological Studies and Clinical Trials, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai, China. Professor Yan Li from the same centre will be the coordinator of the trial. 20 research oriented hospitals will participate in the recruitment of the study subjects. At least 20 subjects should be recruited in each of the participating hospitals.

AB  -  Objectives Main Objective: To evaluate the impact of the home blood pressure telemonitoring through a device with integrated SMS system, in blood pressure values in uncontrolled hypertensive patients. Secondary objectives: 1. Compare adherence to treatment at the beginning and end of the follow‐up between the group that uses integrated tele‐monitoring with SMS and the usual monitoring. 2. Describe the experiences of the participants of the intervention group with the tele‐monitoring system. Methods Study design: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted, which will be followed for 1 month. The main measurement will be to evaluate the difference in blood pressure levels in both groups at the end of the follow‐up, the intervention group would use the device for 2 weeks. Intervention group: Tele‐monitoring with sphygmomanometer with SMS capacity Control group: Regular monitoring Follow‐up time: 1 month Primary Outcome: Difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure Population: Hypertensive patients who attend a Primary Care Centers: Condevilla Health Center Inclusion criteria: Older than 18 years‐old. Diagnosis of hypertension more than 3 months ago. Not Controlled In antihypertensive medication Exclusion criteria: Patient with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Pregnant women. Travel or change of address in the next 1 month. Sample: A sample of 20 participants per group was calculated, with a significance of 95% and a power of 80%, to show a difference of 10 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 10 and 12 according to the literature evaluated. Assignment of groups: A selection of patients will be made in the clinic of the health centers. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, they will be invited to participate in the study, after accepting and signing the informed consent, a randomization will be made for complete blocks of 4 (2 controls, 2 interventions) until the total of 40 participants is reached, 20 in the intervention group and 20 in the control group. Intervention group: Participants will receive general education on hypertension and general care as well as training for the use of the tensiometer and a graphic guide provided by the manufacturer of the tensiometer. The participants of the intervention group will receive a commercial blood pressure monitor "Omron Series 10®" which was integrated into an SMS messaging system using open hardware developing boards. The measurement scheme will be programmed 4 times a day: 2 in the morning, and 2 in the evening with a 3‐minute interval. If no record is received in 24hrs, specific reminder text messages will be sent to the patient, caregiver and/or relative, if after 2 days, there is no measurement, the patient will be contacted by phone and / or caregiver / family. The SMS of the tensiometer to the information center will include the following data: Systolic blood pressure Diastolic blood pressure Heart Rate Date Hour The sphygmomanometer SMS will be sent to the information and monitoring center that will be hosted on a server in the cloud. The information and monitoring system will store blood pressure records and would be accessible to the primary care centers physicians, they would be free to any decision making regarding treatment adjustment or scheduling visits to the patients. Development of tensiometer with SMS capacity: An information acquisition and SMS sending station capable of capturing the tensiometer measurement will be developed using Arduino ® development cards. The tensiometer will be linked through its USB interface to the development board, which in turn will send the blood pressure data automatically. It should be mentioned that the operation of the tensiometer has not been altered, and remains the same as that recommended by the manufacturer. At the end of the pressure collection, the data will be sent automatically. Control group: The control group will receive the same educational session, and the usual monitoring in Health Centers will continue. Outcome: The difference in blood pressure values will be made, after 1 month of follow‐up, under the same conditions as the initial measurement, as well as adherence to treatment, complications, and compliance with scheduled appointments during follow‐up. Analysis plan: The primary statistical analysis will be a Mann‐Whitney test of two independent samples comparing the change in blood pressure measured between the baseline and after 1 month of follow‐up. A secondary analysis of medication differences, adherence to treatment, complications, and fulfillment of appointments will be made, between the 2 study groups The level of significance will be given by a value of p <0.05. Ethical aspects Written informed consent will be requested from participants and caregivers / relatives. The equipment will include a SIM card that will be recharged by the researchers of the study, as well as the cost of the equipment and the messaging packages will be covered by the researchers throughout the follow‐up. The present protocol will be presented to the CIE of the UPCH as well as to the CIE of the HNCH for its approval. The data obtained will be confidential, the personal identifiers will be separated from the analysis database, which will be stored in a separate database, stored with a password to which only the researchers will have access. The SMS data will be sent in an encrypted way so that it can only be read by the information center.

AB  -  Treatment decisions for hypertension using sphygmomanometer based measurements and the current clinical practice paradigm do not account for the timing of blood pressure (BP) measurement. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical implications of discordance between measured and true BP, to quantify BP misclassification rate at a typical clinical visit in current clinical practice, and to propose a BP calibration system to decrease the impact of timing of BP measurement. A clinical trial simulation case study was performed using an in silico Monte Carlo Simulation approach. The time‐courses of BPs with and without an antihypertensive treatment effect were simulated from a baseline BP model combined with an antihypertensive PK/PD model. Virtual subject characteristics were sampled from the FDA internal database. The baseline BP model was qualified using observed 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) data from 225 subjects by a visual predictive check as well as a global sensitivity analysis. First of all, our results showed that the measured cuff BP in current typical clinical practice deviated from the true values. (1) Cuff BP deviated from the true values by more than 5 mmHg in 57 % (95 % CI: 54‐61 %) of patients and more than 10 mmHg in 26 % (95 % CI: 22‐32 %) of patients respectively. (2) These discordances were reduced to 28 % (deviation ≥ 5 mmHg, 95 % CI: 18‐40 %) and 9 % (deviation ≥ 10 mmHg, 95 % CI: 4‐18%) of patients assuming perfect sphygmomanometer measurement and thus represent the contribution of ignoring the daily circadian rhythm of BP. Secondly, our results showed 23‐32 % of patients were misclassified to an incorrect BP category for a casual clinical visit based on JNC 7 guideline. In addition, the accuracy of the measured cuff BP varied by time of clinic visit. Specifically, 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM was identified to be the better time frame, while times before 9:00 AM were the worst time frame. Therefore, clinic visit time may need to be adjusted accordingly. Finally, we proposed an easy BP calibration method for clinic use to adjust for time of day differences due to circadian variability in case that the desirable clinic visit time cannot be tailored for practical reasons.

AB  -  The antihypertensive and metabolic effects of lisinopril 20 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg in fixed combination were compared with those of captopril 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in fixed combination in a double‐blind clinical trial. After a 3‐week placebo run‐in period, two parallel groups of hypertensive patients (188 patients in total) each received one treatment once a day for 6 weeks. Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer and on two occasions by 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Results indicate that both treatments have similar effects on casual blood pressure measurements, while ABPM recordings show that the lisinopril 20 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg combination is more effective during the last period of the dosing interval. Lisinopril 20 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg as combination antihypertensive treatment does not induce alterations in serum potassium and triglycerides.

AB  -  The purpose of this study was to determine if epidural ketamine combined with a local anesthetic provides better postoperative anesthesia in hip and femur surgery. Fifty patients admitted to Balbuena General Hospital, ages 18 to 60 and ASA I‐II, were enrolled the study. Once in the operating room, they were randomized to two groups, 25 patients each. Type I monitoring (cardioscope, sphygmomanometer and pulse oximeter) was used. An epidural catheter was inserted in both groups of patients for intraoperative anesthetic management, later used for postoperative analgesia. Upon termination of surgery, patients in Group 1 were given bupivacaine 20 mg in 10 ml saline solution; patients in Group 2 received ketamine, 200 mug/kg + bupivacaine 20 mg in 10 ml saline solution. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, degree of motor blockade, VAS and side effects were monitored at 15 and 30 minutes and at 1,2,4, 8, 16 and 24 hours postoperatively. Results showed no statistically significant differences in vital signs. In Group 1, the VAS score at 4 hours was 5.45 + 1.85; in Group 2 it was 2.19 + 1.69. Ketamine combined with a local anesthetic provided better quality and longer lasting postoperative analgesia, with no adverse effects.

AB  -  The antihypertensive effect of daily doses of three beta‐adrenoblockers (Bisoprolol, 10 mg once a day, propranolol, 80 mg twice a day, and methoprolol, 100 mg twice a day), and placebo was examined in 14 patients with persistent mild and moderate hypertension during a double blind cross‐over study by using 24‐hour monitoring of blood pressure and its routine measurements. The latter made by a mercury sphygmomanometer indicated that the antihypertensive and negative chronotropic effect of Bisoprolol in a dose of 10 mg remained 24 hours after its administration and it did not significantly differ from that of the two other agents given in the above doses. The application of 24‐hour blood pressure monitoring allows a more pronounced antihypertensive effect of bisoprolol to be revealed during 24 hours than that displayed by the two agents. Bisoprolol is an effective and safe antihypertensive agent. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: This is a non‐therapeutic mechanistic physiological study. All the following measurements and tests described will be conducted by a trained human physiologist staff member. At an initial visit to the laboratory, written informed consent will be obtained from participants who will then undergo screening and familiarization. Anthropometric (height, weight, hip‐to‐waist ratio), demographic, clinical history information will be obtained, and health questionnaires and 7‐day physical activity recall data will be collected. Participants will then attend a single experimental session lasting ~3 hours, including set‐up time. Experimental sessions will be scheduled ~2‐7 days after the initial familiarisation / screening visit, as appropriate. However, premenopausal women will be studied during the first five days of their menstrual cycle (early follicular phase) or during the placebo/no‐hormone phase of oral contraceptive use, as appropriate. At the experimental session, participants will be asked to lie in a semi‐recumbent position on a medical examination couch and to remain in that position throughout the session. Bilateral internal carotid and vertebral artery blood flow will be measured using duplex Doppler ultrasound. This ultrasound examination is similar to scan done for pregnant women, but a large artery is examined. This is a simple and safe procedure and involves a probe being put on the patientsâ€™ skin over the region of interest with the help of a â€˜water jellyâ€™. Participants will then be instrumented for continuous monitoring of BP, heart rate (HR), respiration, brachial artery blood flow and sympathetic nerve activity. More specifically, brachial BP will be measured with a clinically validated automated sphygmomanometer (Omron), using a cuff wrapped around the upper arm. In addition, beat‐to‐beat BP will be measured using finger photoplethysmography, using a small lightweight cuff wrapped around the finger. Heart rate will be CONDITION: Cardiovascular ‐ Hypertension Hypertension; ; Hypertension Respiratory ‐ Normal development and function of the respiratory system PRIMARY OUTCOME: Muscle sympathetic nerve activity as assessed by microneurography.; ; [: Assessed at multiple timepoints during a single experimental session: hypercapnic hyperoxia (primary timepoint), isocapnic hypoxia, hypercapnic hypoxia, isocapnic hyperoxia and hypocapnic hyperoxia; ] SECONDARY OUTCOME: Blood pressure as assessed by finger photoplethysmography.[Assessed at multiple timepoints during a single experimental session: hypercapnic hyperoxia, isocapnic hypoxia, hypercapnic hypoxia, isocapnic hyperoxia and hypocapnic hyperoxia] INCLUSION CRITERIA: ‐ Patients with essential hypertension (Stage 2, treated controlled or uncontrolled; office SBP greater than 140 mmHg or DBP greater than 90 mmHg); ‐ Normotensive controls (office SBP less than 120 mmHg and DBP less than 80 mmHg); ‐ BMI less than 35 kg.m2.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Losartan potassium, the first nonpeptide selective blocker of angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor, has been shown to exhibit clinical antihypertensive effects. The aim of the present study was to characterize the efficacy and duration of action of losartan by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. METHODS: The study was performed in nonblack hypertensive patients whose baseline untreated clinical diastolic blood pressures were 95 mm Hg or higher and whose average 24‐hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressures were 85 mm Hg or higher. Patients were randomized, double‐blind, into four treatment groups: placebo (n = 32) or losartan, 50 mg once daily (n = 29), 100 mg once daily (n = 30), or 50 mg twice daily (n = 31). Clinical and 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressures were measured at baseline (off treatment for at least 4 weeks) and after 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: By clinical sphygmomanometer measurements at the end of the 24‐hour or 12‐hour dosing intervals (trough), all three losartan dosages were significantly more effective than placebo at decreasing systolic and diastolic blood pressures. By average 24‐hour ambulatory systolic/diastolic blood pressure measurements, the decreases produced were 0.0/0.2 mm Hg for placebo and 9.2/6.9, 9.9/6.4, and 13.2/8.5 mm Hg, respectively, for losartan, 50 mg once daily, 100 mg once daily, and 50 mg twice daily. All drug effects were different from placebo (P < .01). The effects of losartan, 50 mg twice daily, were not significantly different from those of losartan, 100 mg once daily, but, as expected, the effects were greater than those of losartan, 50 mg once daily (P < .05). Addition of hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg/d, during an additional 2‐week treatment period in patients whose clinical diastolic blood pressure remained at 85 mm Hg or higher while receiving monotherapy produced additional and clinically meaningful blood pressure decrements that were similar in all four treatment groups. There was no clinically important difference in the incidence of adverse events among the losartan‐treated and placebo groups [corrected]. CONCLUSION: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, which virtually eliminated antihypertensive placebo responses, demonstrated clear 24‐hour efficacy for losartan, 50 mg once daily, as well as for higher doses of 100 mg once daily and 50 mg twice daily. This AT1 receptor blocker had antihypertensive effects that appeared additive when combined with low‐dose diuretic therapy. Losartan was generally well tolerated.

AB  -  To investigate the efficacy and safety of antihypertensive treatment with captopril (CAP) or carteolol (CAR) in elderly patients, 39 hypertensive patients over 60 years of age including 9 apoplectics and 7 diabetics were randomly allocated to either the CAP group (37.5 mg/day) or the CAR group (15 mg/day). The mean age was 73.5 years in the CAP group and 71.9 years in the CAR group. Blood pressure was measured in a supine position and immediately after taking a standing position, using a COPAL digital sphygmomanometer. No significant differences were found between the CAP and CAR groups in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures throughout the study. In CAP group, supine blood pressure significantly decreased from 186.2/96.9 to 161.0/88.1 mmHg after 12 weeks of treatment, while in CAR group it also significantly decreased from 178.3/89.5 to 160.7/83.4 mmHg. Systolic pressure changes on standing were ‐16.9 and ‐20.8 mmHg before and 12 weeks after CAP treatment, respectively, whereas corresponding changes were ‐13.5 and ‐14.1 mmHg in CAR treatment. Differences between CAP and CAR treatment groups and differences within both groups before and after treatment were not statistically significant. Serum creatinine levels were slightly but significantly increased in both treatment groups. The serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, potassium and uric acid remained unchanged. Dopamine β‐hydroxylase activities in serum significantly decreased in both groups. The number of cases complaining of black out on standing or dizziness did not increase. It is concluded that treatment with either CAP or CAR is not only effective but also safe in elderly hypertensives as well as in younger ones if patients are under close observation.

TI  -  Dairy calcium supplementation and its effects on the blood pressure of normotensive adult females
PY  -  2003
CC  -  Hypertension
AB  -  Numerous risk factors for hypertension have been identified. Many are nutritional in nature, including calcium. An inverse relationship has been suggested between calcium intake and blood pressure (BP) levels, however the results remain equivocal. This study investigated the influence of increased dairy calcium consumption on BP in young (18‐30 years), healthy, females who were assigned to one of the following cohorts via stratified randomization according to caloric intake: usual care (control), 900‐1000 mg/day, and 1200‐1300 mg/day of calcium. Caloric intake was held constant by substituting customary food items with low‐fat dairy products. Weight changes were monitored and used as a control variable. The American Heart Association's standard procedure was used to measure BP at baseline, 6 and 12 months with a random zero sphygmomanometer. The average of the last 2 of 3 blood pressures assessed in a seated posture was utilized in the analysis. A Pearsons correlation indicated that calcium intake was not correlated to SBP at any time. However, there was a trend for a positive correlation with DBP. A GLM analysis indicated that the control cohort had a lower calcium intake than the experimental cohorts at 6 and 12 months; however, the experimental cohorts were not different at either time point. Weight was a significant predictor of BP at all time points. It remained a significant predictor of SBP at 6 and 12 months and DBP at 12 months after controlling for baseline values of weight, cohort assignment and BP. Cohort assignment did not have a significant influence on BP at any time. Change in weight from baseline to 6 months had a significant direct relationship with change in DBP and SBP at that time point. Since the experimental cohorts did not differ with respect to calcium intake, they were collapsed and compared to the control cohort, however the results remained unchanged. A GLM analysis controlling for baseline BP, weight, and cohort assignment indicated that oral contraceptive use was not related to BP. In conclusion, in these young normotensive females weight was the most consistent predictor of BP, and increased dairy calcium intake did not impact BP.

AB  -  Measurement of systolic blood pressure (BP) in the elderly can be inaccurate due to observer errors such as terminal digit preference and expectation bias. Efforts to reduce these errors include use of trained observers, random‐zero sphygmomanometers, and automatic BP recorders. To evaluate the value of an infrasonic recorder, the infrasonde, we compared simultaneous systolic BP determinations obtained directly by intra‐arterial measurements, and indirectly by a standard cuff‐mercury sphygmomanometer using clinic nurses (casual and serial measurements), a trained physician assistant (PA), and the Infrasonde in 36 elderly hypertensive men. All the indirect measurements correlated positively with the direct measurement. A terminal digit preference for zero occurred more frequently in the casual and serial readings compared with the Infrasonde and PA cuff readings: 45% and 51% vs 21% and 22%, respectively. Our data suggest that the Infrasonde is a reliable, alternative device for systolic BP measurement that eliminates observer biases associated with standard cuff BP recordings.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect on antihypertensive efficacy produced by the addition of indomethacin to the angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist, valsartan, or to the angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, in hypertensive patients with chronic osteoarthritis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty‐eight patients (52 men and 76 women) aged 25‐82 years (mean age 55.7 years), with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 100 mmHg at the end of a 2‐week placebo washout period were allocated randomly to groups to receive valsartan (80‐160 mg once daily) or lisinopril (10‐20 mg once daily). At the end of 10 weeks of treatment, patients with DBP < 90 mmHg, while continuing to receive valsartan or lisinopril treatment, were allocated randomly to groups to receive either indomethacin (50 mg three times a day) or the corresponding placebo for 2 weeks, with a 1‐week washout period between the two treatments, according to a double‐blind, crossover design. After the initial washout period, patients were examined at the end of the 4th, 8th and 10th weeks of randomized treatment with valsartan and lisinopril, at the end of the first crossover period and then at the beginning and at the end of the second crossover period. At each visit, sitting and standing blood pressure were measured by standard mercury sphygmomanometer. RESULTS: The addition of indomethacin blunted the blood pressure‐decreasing effect of both antihypertensive drugs. Although indomethacin produced greater increases in both systolic and DBP values in the lisinopril‐treated patients (5.45/3.22 mmHg) than in the valsartan‐treated ones (2.12/1.87 mmHg), no significant difference between the two drugs was found. CONCLUSIONS: From a theoretical standpoint, these findings suggest that prostaglandins may play a part in the antihypertensive action of Ang II antagonists. From a practical standpoint, hypertensive patients treated with valsartan or with lisinopril should be monitored to detect changes in blood pressure control while receiving indomethacin.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: Participant's GPs will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group by the coordinating centre using computer‐generated random number tables. Participants whose GPs are in the intervention group will receive an intervention involving self‐monitoring of antihypertensive medication, self‐measurement of blood pressure and diet and physical exercise. Patients will receive a blood pressure monitor, which they will be trained to use correctly. Blood pressure will be measured twice a day (morning and afternoon) for the first and third week of each month of the 12 month study duration. Patients will be asked to record their weekly average blood pressure in a table. The current medication of the patient will be registered. Self‐adjustment of medication was completed according to the following algorithm: Step 1: If between the 3 drugs there is no diuretic, use a thiazide diuretic at a dose equal to 50% of the maximum recommended dose (MRD). If there are no contraindications, remove the non‐BCC, ACEI or ARA II Step 2: If any of the 3 active principles are prescribed at <50% of the MRD, increase it to 50% of the MRD. If there are 2 or 3 drugs at sub‐optimal doses, follow the same order as recommended below. Step 3: Start the dose increase by diuretic up to 50%, provided there is no hyperuricemia or diabetes. In this case, the first drug to be increased will be ACEI or ARA II Step 4: The second drug to increase for patients aged over 60 years is BCC; for patients under 60 years, increase the IECA or ARA II Step 5: The third drug to increase is the remaining drug (BCC, ACEI or ARA II) Step 6: In the same order, the 3 drugs will be increased to MRD (if this is adequately tolerated) Step 7: When the 3 drugs have been increased to optimal doses and control values are not obtained, add spironolactone. In patients aged over 60, the dose increase will be slower, rising first to half of the standard dose, standard dose and double standard dose. Patients will also CONDITION: Hypertension ; Circulatory System ; Difficult to control hypertension PRIMARY OUTCOME: Blood pressure, measured at the baseline 12 months after the start of the intervention, carried out by external personnel who remain blind to the group of the patients. A reduction of at least 5 mmHg in systolic pressure at the end of the study will be considered significant. Blood pressure will be measured while the patient is sitting, using a standardized automated sphygmomanometer (OMROM 7 intelli IT) after a 5‐minute period of rest. Two blood pressure readings will be taken 1 to 2 minutes apart and the average will be recorded. The width of the cuff will adapt to the perimeter of the arm and placed on the middle third of the arm. The patient must be seated comfortably and without crossing the legs and with the arm resting on a table and placed at the level of the heart. The patient will be relaxed, with the urinary bladder empty and without having previously smoked or ingested stimulating substances. SECONDARY OUTCOME: 1. Percentage of patients who have reached systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels considered to be under control (< 140/90 mm Hg) after 12 months, assessed as per primary outcome measure; 2. Quality of life, assessed using the EuroQol‐5D questionnaire at the baseline and after 12 months; 3. Proportion of people showing a significant reduction in baseline cardiovascular risk, assessed using the REGICOR risk score at the baseline and after 12 months; 4. Adherence to the hypertensive medication, assessed using MPR "Medication Possession Ratio" of the antihypertensive medication registered in the electronic prescription of the patient's medical record, assessed after 12 months; 5.

AB  -  The patients will be recruited from the Sleep Laboratory, Heart Institute (InCor), University of São Paulo Medical School. Male adults with a sleep study within 1 month showing severe OSA (>30 events of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep) and naive to treatment will be considered for the study. Age and body mass index matched controls will be recruited from the hospital staff and their relatives. All volunteers will be previously screening for the risk of OSA with Berlin Questionnaire. To minimize confounding risk factors, we will exclude subjects older than 60 years and those with a body mass index (BMI) >40 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, valvular heart disease, renal failure, current or past smoking history, and chronic use of any medication. Hypertension will be excluded after 3 or more normal blood pressure values (<140/90mm Hg) obtained on separate occasions with a conventional mercury sphygmomanometer. Sleep Study. All participants will perform a standard overnight polysomnography. Apnea will be defined as complete cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds, associated with oxygen desaturation of 3%. Hypopnea will be defined as a significant reduction (>50%) in respiratory signals for at least 10 seconds associated with oxygen desaturation of 3%. The apnea‐hypopnea index will be calculated as the total number of respiratory events (apneas plus hypopneas) per hour of sleep. Normal values will be considered when the apnea‐hypopnea index will be <5events/hour. The participants will be randomly assigned to no treatment (control) or treatment with CPAP for 3 months, according to a computer‐generated list of random numbers. At baseline and after 3 months, the participants will be submitted to cardiac MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging methods. Participants will perform MRI examination on 1.5 ‐ T GE CV/i system. Short and long‐axis of the heart will be obtained during breath‐hold and triggered on electrocardiogram pulse sequences. The first sequence will be a gradient‐echo (steady‐sate free procession) to assess left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) morphology and function. The second sequence will be an inversion‐recovery prepared gradient‐echo to obtain MDE (10 to 20 minutes after intravenous bolus of 0.2 mmol/Kg of gadolinium‐based contrast). We will use the following parameters: repetition time 3.9/7.1ms, echo time 1.7/3.1 ms, flip angle 45º/20º, cardiac phases 20/1, views per segment 8/16 to 32, matrix 256 x 128/256 x 192, slice thickness 8/8mm, gap between slices 2/2mm and field of view 32 to 38/32 to 38 cm, inversion time none/150 to 250 ms, receiver bandwidth 125/31,25 kHz, number of excitations 1/2. Blood Samples. Venous blood will be collected from all participants between 8 and 10 AM for the measurement of glucose, total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein, high‐density lipoprotein, and red blood cell count. 24‐hour blood pressure monitoring. All participants will be submitted to a 24‐hour blood pressure monitoring with a SpaceLabs device (model 90207).

AB  -  The antihypertensive and metabolic effects of lisinopril 20 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg in fixed combination were compared with those of captopril 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in fixed combination in a double‐blind clinical trial. After a 3‐week placebo run‐in period, two parallel groups of hypertensive patients (188 patients in total) each received one treatment once a day for 6 weeks. Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer and on two occasions by 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Results indicate that both treatments have similar effects on casual blood pressure measurements, while ABPM recordings show that the lisinopril 20 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg combination is more effective during the last period of the dosing interval. Lisinopril 20 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg as combination antihypertensive treatment does not induce alterations in serum potassium and triglycerides.

AB  -  Participants After sample size calculation (see statistical analysis session), 40 hypertensives and 40 normotensive sedentaries will be recruited to this study. All volunteers (both sexes) will be adults without osteoarticular disabilities and they will need a medical authorization to physical exercise practice. Participants will be recruited from an exercise program project linked to the university that offered stretching and functional exercises sessions to the external community. The study follow the Declaration of Helsinki and the Institutional Ethics Committee approved all experimental procedures and protocols. Each participant will be fully informed of all potential risks and experimental procedures, after which, informed written consent will be signed. Table 1 shows the basics characteristics of the participants. Study design A double‐blind crossover randomized clinical trial will be conducted. After the minimum interval (48 hours), the subjects will be randomly (using a random number table ‐ https://www.random.org/) submitted to four experimental situations (exercise/L‐citrulline, exercise/L‐arginine, exercise/placebo, exercise/L‐citrulline + L‐arginine). The participants will ingested a sachet, which contained L‐citrulline malate (6 grams) or L‐arginine (8 grams) or placebo (6 grams of corn starch) dissolved in water. The substances will be ingested 120 minutes before the experimental or control session. Anthropometric measures will be taken before the rest period. The exercise session consisted of 5 min to warm up (50% of 65% HRreserve) and 40 minutes of run/walk at 60‐70% HRreserve (or 12‐14 ratings of perceived exertion [RPE](1) if take some beta‐blocker medicines) in a treadmill. This will be followed by a progressive cooldown (5 minutes). In the control session, the participants will be remained seated in a quiet room for 40 min. After the exercise/control sessions, the blood pressure will be measured every 10 minutes over the course of 60 minutes and the heart rate variability will be recorded continuously for 60 minutes (laboratorial phase). Then, 15 minutes will be given to the participants to take a shower and change the clothes before the ambulatory blood pressure device be attached on their arm. The ambulatory blood pressure will be recorded over 24 hours. In the next day, the participants will be asked to return to the laboratory to remove the device. Anthropometry The weight will be measured by the digital anthropometric scale (Urano, OS 180A, Canoas, Brasil), with accuracy of 0.1kg and height will be measured by stadiometer with accuracy of 0.1cm, in accordance with the procedures described by Gordon et al (2). The body mass index (BMI) will be defined as the body mass (kg) divided by the square of the body height. Office Blood Pressure (laboratorial phase) The office blood pressure measurements will be taken with oscillometric device (Omron MX3 Plus, Bannockburn, EUA) previously validated for clinic measures in adults (3). Firstly, the participants remained seated (rest period) in calm, quiet and thermoneutral (22°‐24°C) environment for 20 min. The blood pressure will be measured three times during the rest period (at 10 min, 15 min and 20 min). The rest blood pressure value will be considered as the average of these three measurements. Immediately following the sessions (exercise or control), the blood pressure will be measured in a quiet environment during 60 minutes. The blood pressure measurements will be taken according to the American Heart Association recommendations (4). Heart rate variability measures The heart rate variability will be monitored during the rest period using a cardiac monitor (Polar RS800CX, Kempele, Finlândia) previously validated (5). The recorded R‐R intervals will be transferred to a computer using a specific software (Polar Pro‐Trainer software, Kempele, Finlândia). The Fast Fourier Transformation will be applied to quantify the low and high frequencies in to normalized units, in accordance with Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (6). The participants will be taking beta‐blockers will be excluded of this analysis. The time domain analisys will be obtained by SDNN (standard deviation of the NN interval), RMSSD (the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals), pNN50 (NN50 count divided by the total number of all NN intervals), indexes. The range interval analysis will be 5 min (rest, previous exercise) and 30 min (post‐exercise ‐ laboratorial phase) using the Kubios HRV, version 2.2 (Kuopio, Finlândia). Ambulatorial blood pressure measures (ambulatorial phase) The ambulatorial blood pressure measurements will be taken with oscillometric device (Dyna‐MAPA ‐ São Paulo, Brazil) attached on the left arm, always by the same investigator, in accordance with procedures described by American Heart Association (4). The participants will be instructioned to keep the arm stand during the measures. The device will be calibrated by direct comparison with mercury sphygmomanometer, by trained technical person, in agreement with recommendations (4). The monitor will be setting to register the systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate every 20 minutes during "daytime" (08:00am to 11:00pm) and every 30 minutes during "night‐time" (11:00pm to 08:00am) to reduce sleep disturbs. The device screen will be electronically blinded to avoid feedback. All participants will be instructed to register and reported their sleep time in a diary on the day after. The data will be recorded in the device memory, then they will be send to a computer using specific software (Aplicação Dyna Mapa ‐ Version 5.0.382.12) for analysis. The average of the valid readings will be above 90% for all participants. Statistical analysis Assuming a standard deviation of 5 mmHg(7) for the systolic blood pressure, an alpha of 5% and a desired statistical power of 80% for detecting a minimum difference of 7 mmHg (7) required 10 subjects in each group. The datas will be presented in the text as mean and standard error. The sphericity Mauchly´s test will be applied. Greenhouse‐Geisser correction will be used if necessary. Then, these datas will be compared with a one‐factor repeated measures general linear model (GLM). Fisher multiple comparisons will be employed to examine differences between pairs of trials. The ambulatory blood pressure will be analysed as awake, sleep and 24 hours of monitoring. Statistical significance will be defined as P<0.05. The statistical analysis will be generated using SPSS, version 20, system for windows.

AB  -  Exaggerated exercise blood pressure (EEBP) predicts mortality. The mechanisms of this association are unknown but have been linked to increased central arterial stiffness and raised central blood pressure (BP) during low‐stress physical activity. Spironolactone has antifibrotic effects that may reduce large artery stiffness and lower exercise central BP. This study aimed to test these hypotheses. Untreated patients without hypertension or coronary artery disease, but with EEBP (N = 112; aged 55+/‐8 years, 58% male), were randomized to 3 months spironolactone (25 mg daily; n=57) or placebo (n=55). An EEBP was defined as brachial BP >190/105 (women) or >210/105 mmHg (men) during maximal exercise. Arterial stiffness was recorded by aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV). Brachial BP was estimated by sphygmomanometer and central BP by radial tonometry at rest, during low‐stress physical activity (cycle ergometry at 60‐70% maximal heart rate) and after maximal exercise. Patients also underwent 24 hour ambulatory BP monitoring (24ABPM), VO2max testing and 2D echocardiography for left ventricular (LV) structure and function. At baseline, aortic PWV was associated with peak exercise systolic BP (SBP) (r=0.24; P=0.01), low‐stress central pulse pressure (r=0.23; P=0.03) and VO2max (r=‐0.29; P=0.003). Compared with placebo, spironolactone significantly reduced 24ABPM SBP (‐3.8+/‐7.3 versus 1.0+/‐8.7 mmHg; P=0.004), maximal exercise brachial SBP (‐8.3+/‐16.3 versus ‐0.5+/‐ 11.0 mmHg; P=0.002) and maximal central SBP (‐7.6+/‐ 11.6 versus ‐1.3+/‐10.5 mmHg; P=0.007) but did not change aortic PWV, VO2maxor LV parameters (P>0.05 for all). Moreover, central SBP (‐5.4+/‐12.1 versus 0.7+/‐13.1 mmHg; P=0.03) and the systolic pressure‐time integral (‐230+/‐477 versus ‐11 +/‐419 mmHg/s) were significantly reduced during low‐stress exercise (P<0.05 for both), whereas low‐stress brachial SBP was unchanged by spironolactone (‐3.8+/‐16 versus 1.0+/‐ 13 mmHg; P=0.14). We conclude that maximal exercise BP, as well as subtle indices of central systolic loading during light activity, are improved by spironolactone in patients with EEBP, but these changes cannot be attributed to reduced central artery stiffness. 31st Annual Scientific Meeting of the High Blood Pressure Research Council of Australia, HBPRCA; 2009 Dec 1‐3; Sydney, NSW, Australia

AB  -  INTERVENTION: This is a non‐therepeutic mechanistic physiological study. Participants will undertake on initial familarisation visit and one experimental visit. At the familarisation visit participants will complete a general health questionnaire and have their height and weight measured. For the experimental visit participants will rest in a supine position on a comfortable hospital bed in a custom built airtight box up to the level of the iliac crest (i.e. a lower body negative pressure chamber). They will be instrumented for the measurement of brain blood flow (transcranaial Doppler ultrasound), blood pressure (finger photoplethysmography and automated sphygmomanometer), breathing rate (spirometer, gas analyser). After a 10 min baseline, three experimental conditions will then be undertaken in a randomised order, namely; 1) neurovascular coupling test with no lower body negative pressure, 2) neurovascular coupling test with ‐20 mmHg lower body negative pressure, and 3) neurovascular coupling test with ‐40 mmHg lower body negative pressure. Each trial will last 10 min. Trials will be separated by 30 min. Neurovacular coupling will be assessed (5 cycles, of 20 s eyes closed and 40 s of reading) during each trial. All sessions will be conducted by a University student (registered for a PhD in Exercise Science) and supervised by an Assoc Prof of Physiology. The mode of administration is one‐to‐one for all activities. A check list will be use to monitor adherence to the intervention. CONDITION: Cardiovascular ‐ Hypertension Hypertension;Cerebrovascular disease; ; Hypertension ; Cerebrovascular disease Neurological ‐ Studies of the normal brain and nervous system PRIMARY OUTCOME: Posterior cerebral artery blood flow velocity response to visual stimulation (neurovascular coupling response) using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. [This outcome (i.e., neurovascular coupling) will be measured three times during the single experimental session. As described in Step 6 and above, it is a 5 min test involving the continuously measured posterior cerebral artery blood flow velocity response to visual stimulation (this is then signal averaged and a peak response obtained). As such. the outcome is measured during each of the three experimental trial.] SECONDARY OUTCOME: Blood pressure (finger photoplethysmography, automated sphygmomanometer)[Assessed continuously throughout the baseline (10 min) and 3 experimental trials (10 min each).] Heart rate (electrocardiogram).[Assessed continuously throughout the baseline (10 min) and 3 experimental trials (10 min each).] Respiration (spirometer, gas analyser). [Assessed continuously throughout the baseline (10 min) and 3 experimental trials (10 min each).] INCLUSION CRITERIA: â€¢Healthy individuals â€¢Not taking any prescription or over‐the‐counter medications (other than oral contraceptive pill) â€¢Body mass index < 30 kg/m2 â€¢No history of syncope (fainting) â€¢Not hypotensive (e.g., have a resting blood pressure >90/60 mmHg)

AB  -  BACKGROUND: This study examined the effect of measuring blood pressure below subjects' rolled‐up sleeves, over the sleeve, or on the bare arm. This is an important day‐to‐day issue for the busy GP. METHODS: The sample consisted of 201 subjects in family practice clinics and residents of a senior citizens' home. A digital device was used in all cases. Each participant underwent three blood pressure measurements in each of the following conditions in random order: cuff on bare arm; cuff over the sleeve; and cuff below the rolled‐up sleeve. Differences between measurements were plotted against the mean blood pressure. Confounding factors controlled for were age, sex, clothing pressure and skin‐fold thickness. RESULTS: Differences in mean blood pressure readings between the clothed and bare arm were 0.5 mmHg (SD 7.5) for systolic pressure and 1 mmHg (SD 5) for diastolic pressure; neither difference was significant. However, in hypertensive subjects (>140 mmHg systolic), although the mean difference remained small (systolic pressure, 2 mmHg, SD 10), the range of difference for individual subjects was ‐32 mmHg to +22 mmHg. CONCLUSION: The degree of clothing under the sphygmomanometer cuff does not have a clinically important effect on the blood pressure measurement. In patients known or found to be hypertensive, measurement on the bare arm is recommended.

AB  -  Volunteers Healthy young male volunteers from the urban area of Sao Paulo city will be recruited to the study. All subjects will be clinically evaluated, including measurements of weight and height. Exclusion criteria include age less than 21 and more than 45 years, body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2, smoking, use of chronic medications and any established medical condition including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart diseases and sleep disordered breathing. After obtaining written informed consent, all participants will be submitted to overnight polysomnography. Polysomnography Overnight polysomnography will be performed to discarded sleep breathing using a digital system (17 channels, EMBLA Medicare ‐ Flaga hf. Medical Devices). All polysomnograms will be performed and scored based on the guidelines for sleep studies. The apnea‐hypopnoea index (AHI) was defined by the number of apneas and hypopnoeas per hour of sleep. Sleep disordered breathing was defined by an AHI above 5 events/hour, according to standard criteria. Sleep Monitoring During the study period all subjects will be continuously monitored by a sleep diary and wrist actigraphy (Basic Mini Motionlogger Actigraph Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc., Ardsley , New York, USA ) worn on the non‐dominant hand. The actigraph will set to sample movements in 1 min periods. Actigraph records will automatically process by use of the AW2 software version 2.3.01 program (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.) to extract information on sleep duration. Blood Samples Venous blood will be collected from all participants between 8 and 10 AM for the measurement of glucose, total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein, high‐density lipoprotein, and red blood cell count. Plasma catecholamine (norepinephrine) will be measured by High‐Performance Liquid Chromatography. Hemodynamic and autonomic measurements Hemodynamic and autonomic evaluations will be performed in the morning between 8 and 10 AM. The intervals between adjacent QRS complexes resulting from sinus node depolarization will be determined (RR intervals). Heart rate will be calculated by expressing RR intervals as beats per minute. Non‐invasive beat‐to‐beat blood pressure (Finometer, Finapres Medical System BV, Holland) and electrocardiogram (ECG) will be continuously recorded by the software AT/MCA‐CODAS (DATAC Instruments Inc., Akron, Ohio, EUA). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz per channel. Autonomic measurements will be derived from spectral analysis of HR and systolic blood pressure (SBP). For frequency domain analysis, power spectral density will be obtained by the Fast Fourier Transformation using the Welch's method over 16,384 points with a Hanning window (512) and 50% overlapping. Spectral power for low‐ (LF 0.04‐0.15 Hz), and high‐ (HF 0.15‐0.4 Hz) frequency bands will be calculated by means of power spectrum density integration within each frequency bandwidth, using a customized routine (MATLAB 6.0, Mathworks). LF/HF ratio will be also calculated to evaluate the sympathovagal balance. In addition, we will also evaluated the power spectral analysis of SBP. The measurements will be evaluated while awake in supine position (5 minutes) and subsequently during head up tilt test maneuver (60 degree inclination, 5 minutes). The results of tilt test will be expressed as the change between rest and head up tilt . Endothelial function Venous endothelial function will be measured by Dorsal Hand Vein technique, previously described by Aellig. Briefly, a 23‐gauge butterfly needle will be inserted into a suitable vein on the back of the hand, with the arm positioned at an upward angle of 30 to allow the complete emptying of veins. A tripod, holding a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) (Shaevitz Engineering, Pennsuaken, NJ), will be mounted on the back of the hand with the central aperture of the LVDT, containing a movable metal core, at a distance of 10 mm downstream from the dip of the needle. The signal output of the LVDT, which will be linearly proportional to the vertical movement of the core, give a measure of the diameter of the vein. Readings will be taken under a congestive pressure of 40 mm Hg by inflating a blood pressure cuff placed on the upper portion of the arm under study. Results will be presented as normalized dose‐response curves in which the diameter of the vein during saline infusion will be defined as 100% dilatation. The vein will be preconstricted to 20% of the baseline size by infusing increasing doses of phenylephrine, a selective A‐adrenergic receptor agonist (25‐3166 ng/min). The infusion rate of phenylephrine inducing 80% venoconstriction will be kept constant during the entire study, rate, and this degree of constriction will be defined as 0% dilatation for the purpose of subsequent calculations. The vasodilator response expressed in this study will be calculated as a percentage of the range between 0 and 100% dilatation. Drugs will be infused using a Harvard infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. After preconstriction of the vein by using phenylephrine, a dose‐response curve of acetylcholine (0.36‐3600 ng/min) and sodium nitroprusside (50‐1000 ng/min) will be constructed with 6 and 2 infusion doses, respectively. Systolic and diastolic BP will be determined before and after each experimental phase with a mercury sphygmomanometer, and heart rate will be measured by the pulse at the radial artery. Experimental Design The entire study period will be of 12 nights. Using a cross over design the subjects will keep under their usual daily activities and randomized to 5 nights of control sleep or partial sleep deprivation, interposed by 2 nights of wash out (unrestricted sleep). During control period, subjects will be instructed to sleep 8 hours, ranging from a minimal of 7 hours and a maximum of 9 hours and 30 minutes. Partial sleep deprivation will consist of a target sleep between of less than 5 hours, but no less than 3 hours and 30 minutes. Subjects who will not comply with the sleep schedule will be excluded from the final analysis. All measurements described above will be made at the end of control and partial sleep deprivation periods.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: A parallel, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial involving 96 non‐ smoking, overweight or obese, aged 30‐65 will be recruited and randomly assigned into 3 groups to daily consume 200g of either control yoghurt containing 1.5% standard yoghurt cultures (Streptococcus thermophiles 1275 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus 1842), 2) symbiotic yoghurt containing 5% of probiotic mixture (1:1; Lactobacilus acidophilus ASCC 2404, Lactobacilus rhamnosus ASCC 1520), 2% Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and inulin (synergy1), and 3) flavored symbiotic yogurt containing 5% of probiotic mixture (1:1; Lactobacilus acidophilus ASCC 2404, Lactobacilus rhamnosus ASCC 1520), 2% FOS and inulin (synergy1) and 20% concentrated pomegranate juice for 8 weeks. Anthropometric measurements and fasting blood samples will be collected at the beginning of the study, week 4 and 8. All participants will be instructed to maintain their usual dietary habits and lifestyle and to avoid consuming any yoghurt other than that provided to them by the researchers throughout the 8‐week trial. The subjects will be also instructed to keep yoghurt under refrigeration and to avoid any changes in medication if possible. The allocation of intervention or control group will be concealed from the researchers and different yoghurt treatment containers will be identical looking. Therefore, neither the subjects nor the investigator will be aware of treatment assignments in this double blind study. Yoghurt samples will be distributed weekly by the researchers. Compliance with the yogurt consumption guidelines will be monitored via phone interviews once per week. In addition, subjects will be also asked to keep a checklist of daily yoghurt consumption throughout the study period. Information on food consumption and anthropometric measurements, and fasting blood samples will be collected at the beginning and at the end of the trial. Nutrient intakes will be estimated using a 24‐h dietary recall at the beginning and at the end of the study for 3 days. Three day averages of energy and macro‐nutrient intakes will be analyzed by food works software. All data entry will be performed by trained dieticians. If a participant ate a food that was not in the database, a food with very similar nutrient composition will be chosen. Nutrient information will be also obtained through food labels or recipes from participants. ANTHEROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS Anthropometric measurement of participants will include height, weight, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure and heart rate, and will be performed by the student researcher with the assistance of selected, trained student practitioners. Weight will be measured with digital scales and height measured with a stadiometer. Waist circumference will be measured twice with the participant standing with their arms crossed across their thorax with a tape measure placed around the body at the narrowest point between the lower costal (10th rib) border and the iliac crest. Hip circumference will also be measured twice, with the participant standing in a relaxed position with arms folded across their thorax at the level of the greatest posterior protuberance of the buttocks. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured twice using an electronic blood pressure machine, where the inflatable cuff of the sphygmomanometer is positioned round the upper arm at the heart level. All measurements will be recorded on summary sheets contained in the participants file and stored in a secure locked filling cabinet. BLOOD COLLECTION The subjects will be directed to the nutrition clinic at the beginning of the study, week 4 and at the end of week 8 for blood tests. The blood sample will be drawn from the antecubital vein in the arm, after an overnight 8‐10 h fast, at the beginning of the trial, week 4 and week 8 of intervention. The blood should be taken between 7 and 10 am on the collection day by a trained phlebotomist. The serum samples will be labelled with the participants’ code for confidentiality and stored one ice until they are centrifuged and stored at ‐20°c until analysed. BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS Blood samples will be analysed at the Health Scope Pathology Centre (St. Alban/ Werribee, Melbourne). Serum concentrations of Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) will be measured using the standard enzymatic methods with commercially available kits. CONDITION: Hypercholesterolemia Hypertension PRIMARY OUTCOME: A 5‐10 % decrease in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol after daily consumption of symbiotic yoghurt, a yoghurt containing Lactobacilus acidophilus ASCC 2404 and Lactobacilus rhamnosus ASCC 1520 as probiotics, in combination with a mixture of fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and inulin as prebiotics in mildly to moderately hypercholesterolemic men and women compared to control group. ; Blood samples will be analysed at the Health Scope Pathology Centre (St. Alban/ Werribee, Melbourne). Serum concentrations of Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) will be measured using the standard enzymatic methods with commercially available kits. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Daily consumption of 200g symbiotic yoghurt fermented by Lactobacilus acidophilus ASCC 2404 and Lactobacilus rhamnosus ASCC 1520 as probiotics, in combination with a mixture of fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and inulin as prebiotics could decrease SBP and DBP by 4.1‐6.7 mm Hg and 1.8‐ 5.0mm Hg, respectively. ; Blood pressure will be measured in the morning 1 h after wake up, in the St Alban clinic. Physical activity and eating are prohibited before the measurement. Measurements will be done using an automated sphygmomanometer (Omron M4, Omron Matsusaka Ltd., Matsusaka, Japan), at the beginning of study, in the middle of the study trial (week 4) and at the end of the study period (week 8). Two recordings will be performed each time. If the readings in systolic pressure were not consistent and differed more than 5 mmHg, further recordings will be done. The subjects are given detailed instructions on performing the measurements. The readings will be recorded in the study diaries. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Mild to moderate hypercholesterolemic men and women (total cholesterol level less than 6.2 mmol/L and triglyceride level less than 2.3 mmol/L), with either overweight or obesity defined by waist circumference >80 cm or Body Mass Index 25‐35 kg/m2. Participants will be free of serious medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and malignancies, and will be non allergic to dairy or lactose, non‐smoking, non‐pregnant and non‐lactating.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: Behavioural Exercise Food and Nutrition Education Health Education Intervention Group: 196 adolescents, enrolled from 7th to 9th grade of elementary school, will undergo a multicomponent school‐based intervention lasting one semester. The term multicomponent refers to the fact that the intervention will take place through classes in all school subjects, changing the school environment through physically active opportunities and through health education strategies, working on topics such as the practice of physical activities, food and nutrition education and reduction of sedentary behavior. Control Group: 196 adolescents, enrolled in the 7th to 9th grade of elementary school, will follow the regular school planning, not undergoing any intervention. CONDITION: Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Obesity Obesity; Sedentary behavior; Hypertension; Diabetes Mellitus ; Obesity ; Sedentary Behavior ; Hypertension ; Diabetes Mellitus Sedentary Behavior Z00‐Z99 PRIMARY OUTCOME: It is expected to find decreased use of screen equipment and decreased sitting time during the day measured through the validated questionnaire PeNSE (National School Health Survey), at the beginning of the study, at the end of the intervention (end of the semester) and at the end of the next semester (follow up) after completion of the intervention. It is expected to find improvements in executive function by decreasing response time and increasing accuracy (correct answers) assessed by the Stroop Test, at the beginning of the study, at the end of the intervention (end of the semester) and at the end of the next semester (follow up) after completion of the intervention. It is expected to find improvements in food intake that will be measured through the validated questionnaire PeNSE (National School Health Survey), at the beginning of the study, at the end of the intervention (end of the semester) and at the end of the next semester (follow up) after completion of the intervention. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Facilitators and barriers to physical activity practices, sedentary behavior reduction and healthy food consumption will be evaluated through a narrative interview with each participant. It will be a process of dialogue and interaction in which teens will talk about what facilitated or was a barrier to following these healthy behaviors. The phases of the narrative interview proposed by Jovchelovich and Bauer (2002) will be followed, which are: Preparation, Initiation, Central Narration, Questioning Phase and Concluding Speech. These measures will be evaluated at the beginning of the study, at the end of the intervention (end of the semester), and at the end of the following semester (follow up) after the conclusion of the intervention. Improvements in the obesogenic environment are expected to be validated by the Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire (FEAHQ‐R). Adolescents and their parents will answer questions regarding the identification and monitoring of behaviors and associated factors that facilitate the development of obesity within the family. These measures will be evaluated at the beginning of the study, at the end of the intervention (end of the semester), and at the end of the following semester (follow up) after the conclusion of the intervention. It is expected to find a reduction in systemic resting blood pressure, measured by a digital sphygmomanometer (Omron 705‐IT), calibrated and certified by the National Institute of Metrology, Standardization and Industrial Quality ‐ INMETRO. A standardized technique will be used according to the procedure described in the 7th Brazilian Hypertension Guidelines and will be classified according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, which takes into account gender and age adjusted for the adolescent's height / age percentile. These measures will be evaluated at the beginning of the study, at the end of the intervention (end of the semester), and at the end of the following semester (follow up) after the conclusion of the intervention. It is expected to find improvements in anthropometric parameters, assessed by body weight, height, waist circumference, subscapular and triceps skinfolds, and sexual maturation. The BMI will be analyzed by the equation Weight (kg) / HeightÂ² (m) and the classification will use the cutoff points recommended by the World Health Organization. The fat percentage will be analyzed through skinfold measurements using the International Society for the Advancement Kinantrophometric (ISAK) guidelines. The evaluation of sexual maturation will be performed by the Tanner method. These measures will be evaluated at the beginning of the study, at the end of the intervention (end of the semester), and at the end of the following semester (follow up) after the conclusion of the intervention. It is expected to find improvements in the biochemical parameters: fasting glucose, fasting insulin, lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides), inflammatory markers (interleukin‐10 and Tumor Necrosis Factor ‐ Alpha) and markers of stress oxidative (glutathione peroxidase and malonaldehyde). Determination of serum concentrations of biochemical parameters will be performed by enzymatic‐colorimetric assays and determinations of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers will be performed by ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunonoSorbent Assay) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. These measures will be evaluated at the beginning of the study, at the end of the intervention (end of the semester), and at the end of the following semester (follow up) after the conclusion of the intervention. INCLUSION CRITERIA: State public schools that work with elementary school from 7th to 9th grade; Have spaces for the practice of physical activities, such as courts and gyms; Adolescents between 12 and 16 years old and properly enrolled.

AB  -  Subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Research Center at Vanderbilt University for the studies. The average inpatient stay is 7 days. Initially a complete history and physical will be performed and the patient will be placed on a low monamine, no methylxanthine, 150 mEq sodium, 60‐80 mEq potassium diet. The following tests will be performed: 1. Meal challenge: We observed profound effects of diet on blood pressure in many patients with orthostatic hypotension. Some patients dropped their blood pressure by 40‐60 mmHg during the postprandial period. Blood pressure will be monitored with an automated device (Dinamap) after feeding the patients with a standardized diet. 2. Physiologic autonomic tests: Patients are studied supine, and blood pressure is monitored with a sphygmomanometer or an automated device (Dinamap, Finapres or tonometer). 1. Orthostatic test: Blood pressure and heart rate are measured in the supine and standing positions. Orthostatic hypotension without an adequate heart rate increase is indicative of autonomic failure. On the other hand, orthostatic tachycardia in the absence of volume depletion is seen in "hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension". 2. Standing time: The time the patient can stand motionless gives a very good indication of functional capacity. 3. Deep breathing: Heart rate is monitored with an ECG and the patient is asked to breathe deeply 6 times each minute for two minutes. Heart rate variation due to respiration is an autonomic function. The loss of this respiratory arrhythmia is indicative of autonomic failure. 4. Valsalva maneuver: The patient is asked to exhale against a 40 mmHg pressure. This produces transient changes in blood pressure and heart rate which are autonomically mediated, and can be monitored with an ECG. Failure to observe heart rate changes is indicative of autonomic failure. 5. Hyperventilation: The patient is asked to hyperventilate for 30 seconds. The normal response is an increase in heart rate and no significant change in blood pressure. Patients with autonomic failure have profound reductions in blood pressure without compensatory heart rate increases. 6. Handgrip: The patient is asked to maintain a handgrip for three minutes. Increases in heart rate and blood pressure are seen in normal subjects but not in patients with autonomic failure. 7. Cold pressor test: The patient is asked to place an hand in ice cold water for one minute. The results are similar to the handgrip test. 8. Supine hypertension screening: We will measure the blood pressure every two hours during one night to determine if the patient has supine hypertension or high blood pressure while lying down. 3. Posture Study: Blood for catecholamine, bradykinins, plasma renin activity, aldosterone and plasma angiotensin II is drawn while the patient is supine and upright. Blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer or an automated device (Dinamap). Normally, on assuming the upright posture, plasma norepinephrine and renin activity should double. Patients with autonomic failure typically show low supine levels of both norepinephrine and renin activity which failed to increase on assuming the upright posture. In contrast, patients with hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension typically have normal or exaggerated responses. 4. Twelve hour urine collections for catecholamines, urinalysis, protein, glucose, creatinine, osmolality, electrolytes and F2‐isoprostanes will be collected to analyze for catecholamine excretion (hormones produces by the autonomic nervous system) oxidative stress markers and to assess the patient's kidney function. 5. Blood will be collected in the fasted state through and intravenous catheter to analyze for PAI‐1, CRP, F2‐isoprostanes, proinflammatory cytokines and renal function. 6. EKG will be recorded while the patient is lying down and while the patient is standing. 7. Orthostatic vital signs will be measured several times a day. This testing consists of blood pressure and heart rate measured while the patient is lying down and then repeated after standing quietly for 10 minutes. Several readings are measured in sequence using an automated blood pressure monitor (Dinamap). 8. Tilt table test: This test uses a tilt table, which is a motorized table with a footboard. The participant rests quietly on the table while the monitoring equipment is assembled. EKG electrodes are applied to the chest to monitor heart rate and rhythm. Blood pressure will be measured with a cuff applied to a finger. Blood pressure will also be checked periodically using a traditional blood pressure cuff wrapped around an upper arm. Safety straps are used to secure the patient to the table to prevent falling or unsteadiness when the table is moved to an upright position. Gradual head up tilt will be performed until a systolic blood pressure of 70 mm Hg is reached or the appearance of symptoms related to hypotension. Changes in cardiac output (heart's pumping capacity) will be measured by analyzing the air that is breathed ("rebreathing test", Innocor). This will be done through a mouthpiece connected to a bag full of air and small concentrations of the inactive gases SF6 and N2O. Subjects will breathe normally through a mouthpiece connected to a bag for about 5 minutes at baseline, at 30º and at the maximum head up tilt. Innocor is FDA approved for inert gases cardiac output measurement. This test may or may not be performed. Some patients may have already undergone this test or it may not be pertinent to a particular patient. The principal investigator will decide whether this test is performed or not. 9. Therapeutic Drug Trials: We will try different medications to determine if blood pressure improves upon standing. For all these tests, blood pressure is monitored with a sphygmomanometer and heart rate with an ECG. The procedures are detailed below. Patients will be in the fasted state in the seated position throughout the study. They will be connected to an automated blood pressure monitor (Dinamap). Thirty minutes after baseline blood pressure and heart rate measurements, they will be given a dose of the medicine to be tested. Blood pressure will be monitored every 5 to 15 minutes for up to four additional hours. Upright blood pressure, heart rate and the standing time will be measure periodically throughout the study. The patients will be asked to rate their symptoms at various time during the study. This study has been designed to determine optimal candidate drugs and therapy for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. Potential pressor agents have been selected for this study because of their different mechanism of action. We propose also to use the combination of different therapeutic agents. For some of these tests,we will do the following: 1. we will determine the effect of the medication on catecholamines and/or markers of inflammation and/or oxidative stress. We will draw a blood sample at baseline and after the medication has taken effect. A saline lock or small flexible intravenous catheter will be placed for this purpose. For each medication trial, the amount of blood drawn would be up to 6 teaspoons. The total blood drawn for all the medication trials would not exceed 36 teaspoons. 2. We will apply external abdominal compression (up to 40mm Hg) to evaluate the ability of this counterpressure method in combination with a pressor agent to improve orthostatic tolerance. For this purpose, we will use an abdominal binder with an inflatable cuff placed underneath, which will be inflated to exert pressure at the level of the umbilicus while patients are standing. Patients may be randomly assigned to 5mm Hg (sham treatment) and/or 20‐40mm Hg external abdominal compression with an abdominal binder applied at baseline of some of the therapeutic trials described above. The principal investigator will decide which medication will be used in each trial. 3. We will measure changes in cardiac output (heart's pumping capacity) by analyzing the air that is breathed ("rebreathing test", Innocor). This will be done through a mouthpiece connected to a bag full of air and small concentrations of the inactive gases SF6 and N2O. Subjects will breathe normally through a mouthpiece connected to a bag for about 5 minutes before and after the medication. Innocor is FDA approved for inert gases cardiac output measurement. 4. We will measure the cerebral blood flow to determine if it can be improved with the medication. A middle cerebral artery will be continuously insonated by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. The transducer will be affixed with head straps. 5. We will apply eleven sticky patches to the front of the body to measure the impedance (electrical resistance). This will allow us to determine fluid shifts between body segments and obtain a continuous measurement of cardiac output and peripheral resistance.

AB  -  Methods. Study Subjects. Adults, males and females, non smoking healthy volunteers, sea‐level residents not engaged in regular endurance exercise training, taking no medications will be recruited. As there are no studies comparing the effects of beta‐blockers on exercise performance at high altitude, the sample size set for each treatment arm was defined on the basis of the sample size of previous investigations showing significant changes in exercise performance in normal subjects taking no medications. Study design. Time 0. Screening, enrollement and randomization. Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo at sea‐level, general laboratory investigations and physical examination. Eligible subjects will be double blindly randomized to either placebo (one tablet twice daily), carvedilol (one 25 mg tablets twice daily), or to nebivolol (one 5 mg tablet in the morning and one placebo tablet in the evening). Time 1. Before starting the medications, at sea level after an overnight fast, subject will undergo: blood pressure and heart rate measurement, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, Doppler heart ultrasound, cardiopulmonary exercise test, resting energy expenditure measurement. Time 2. After three weeks of allocated treatment, at sea‐level, after an overnight fast, subjects will undergo: blood pressure and heart rate measurement, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, Doppler heart ultrasound, cardiopulmonary exercise test, resting energy expenditure measurement. Time 3. Under treatment within the first two days of high altitude exposure (Regina Margherita hut, Monte Rosa, altitude 4559 m), subjects will undergo after an overnight fast to blood pressure and heart rate measurement, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, Doppler heart ultrasound, cardiopulmonary exercise test, resting energy expenditure measurement, acute mountain sickness quantification by the Lake Louise Score. ‐ Protocol for blood pressure and heart rate measurement. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured according to current European guidelines(Task Force for the Management of Arterial Hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension(ESH) and of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). 2007 Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension. J Hypertens 2007; 25:1105‐1187. ‐ Protocol for 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed according to current European guidelines(O'Brien E, et al. Practice guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension for clinic, ambulatory and self blood pressure measurement. J Hypertens 2005; 23: 1697‐701). ‐ Protocol for Doppler heart ultrasound. All echographic‐Doppler examinations will be performed by the same two operators using a portable device (Vivid I, GE Ultrasound) according to current guidelines (Lang RM, et al. Recommendations for chamber quantification. Eur J Echocardiogr 2006; 7 : 79‐108 ‐ Protocol for cardiopulmonary exercise test. Tests will be performed and evaluated according to current European Society of Cardiology guidelines (Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil 13:150‐164 2006; Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil 2006; 13:300‐311). All tests will be performed using the same cyclo‐ergometer (Ergometrics 100, Ergoline, Bitz, Germany)and metabolic cart (Oxycon Mobile software v. 4.6, VIASYS Healthcare GmbH, Wurburg, Germany). The exercise protocol will include 10 minutes of monitored sitting rest, followed by 3 minutes of unloaded pedalling and by 30 W load increments every 2 minutes up to exhaustion. Breath‐by‐breath ventilation, respiratory gases, one‐lead ECG and pulse oxymetry (SpO2) will be recorded throughout each test. Arterial blood pressure will be measured by a mercury sphygmomanometer in duplicate at the end of the resting phase and of each 30 W step, and at peak exercise. Cardiopulmonry exercise tests will be blindly and independently evaluated by two expert readers. The anaerobic threshold will be identified by the standard technique (Wasserman K. Breathing during exercise. N Engl J Med 1978; 298:780‐785. VE/VCO2 slope will be calculated as the slope of the linear relationship between VE and VCO2 measured up to the respiratory compensation point. ‐ Protocol for resting energy expenditure measurement. The energy expenditure was calculated according to the abbreviated formula provided by Weir (Weir JB. New methods for calculating metabolic rate with special reference to protein metabolism. J Physiol Lond 1949; 55:14‐21). O2 consumption and CO2 production (integrated over 1 min) were measured for 30 min. Baseline values were calculated by averaging the readings taken during the last 10 min. ‐ Protocol for assessment of acute mountain sickness. Acute mountain sickness (AMS) will be assessed by means of the Lake Louise AMS Scoring system (Roach RC, Bärtsch P et al. The Lake Louise AMS Scoring Consensus Committee. The Lake Louise acute mountain sickness scoring system. In: Sutton JR, Houtson CS, Coates G, eds. Hypoxia and Molecular Medicine. Burlington, VT: Queen City Printers; 1993:272‐274). ‐ Statistical analysis. Data will be reported as means ± SD. Data management and analysis will be performed with SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Differences among groups, changes over time within each group (time effect), and any interaction (differing trends over time among groups), will be assessed by two‐way repeated measures ANOVA with unpaired Student's t‐test with Bonferroni correction whenever needed. For all parameters during cardiopulmonary exercise test, mean values will be computed over 20 seconds. Spearman correlations will be used to assess the relationship between peak VO2 and other respiratory and haemodynamic variables at altitude. A P level of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: Exercise Hydrotherapy Other Randomized cross‐over study: Individuals selected for participation in the study will be randomly allocated to one of two groups to start in either a control session (CS) or experimental session (ES) and then will perform the other session one week after the initial session. All participants will perform both sessions, after one week been randomized for the first session, he or she will perform the other session. The ES of aquatic aerobic exercise will last 45 minutes and consists of 5 minutes of warm‐up, 35 minutes of continuous aerobic activity ("pedaling" with the stump and preserved lower limb, with the trunk stabilized) and 5 minutes of cool down, performed in a pool with thermoneutral water (average of 33.5 ÂºC) and a depth of 140 cm, with the whole body immersed, keeping only the head out of the water. The participants will perform the session using a pulsimeter to control and maintain HR during exercise in the aquatic environment. The exercise training range will be predicted according to the formula published by Kruel et al. [26]: exercise HR = % x (HRmax ‐ ?HR), where % is the exercise intensity, HRmax is the maximum HR estimated by the calculation 220 â€“ age, and ?HR is the difference between HR at rest outside the pool and HR at rest inside the pool. The intensity range from 55‐60% HRmax during warm‐up, 70‐75% HRmax during the proposed aerobic exercise, and 55‐60% HRmax during cool down. In the CS, which will also last 45 minutes, the participants remain seated, in the same aquatic environment, with the body immersed and the head out of the water but without performing any physical activity. If they wish, they will be allowed to talk during the session but had to remain at rest. In both sessions, the BP will be measured in a sitting position, us CONDITION: Amputation Amputation, Hypertension ; Amputation ; Hypertension Hypertension PRIMARY OUTCOME: Maintaining blood pressure levels in similar levels after aquatic aerobic exercise and comparing to rest, measuring systolic and diastolic blood pressure using a digital arm sphygmomanometer before the session (after 20 minutes at rest), immediately after the session in the pool, and at 10, 20 and 30 minutes after the end of the session â€“ T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, respectively, also at rest. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Acute increase in heart rate in the experimental session right after leaving the pool, returning to baseline levels in the first minutes of resting on the ground. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Individuals with a unilateral transfemoral amputation, who were male (women not included to avoid possible hormonal interference), aged between 40 and 65 years, with a medical diagnosis of systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) controlled with medication, with systolic blood pressure (SBP) ?160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ? 100 mmHg at rest at the time of assessment; and already adapted to the water environment (so that a possible anxiety or fear of being in the pool could be avoided) will be included.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: G11.427.410.698.277 The study involved only one group of hypertensive patients (n=34), and the parameters were compared at baseline and after six months of exercise. For the socio‐demographic survey, questionnaires were used in the form of interviews, regarding schooling, smoking, occurrence of previous cardiovascular event and use of medications. The other data were collected in two moments, before the beginning of the exercise program, on the day of signing the informed consent, and after three months, at the end of the protocol. The exercise protocol was performed twice a week in the afternoon, within the Santo Amaro University Campus 1, lasting approximately ninety minutes a day. It consisted of thirty minutes of initial walking, thirty minutes of free active exercises for upper limbs and trunk‐shaped circuit, and thirty minutes of final walk. The circuit was composed of five exercises performed during one minute each, repeating six series. The exercises performed were: trunk flexion, shoulder flexion, shoulder extension, horizontal abduction of the shoulders, lateral flexion of the spine.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a multifactorial intervention compared with standard treatment in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Patients with peripheral arterial disease are also at risk of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Studies have shown that patients with peripheral arterial disease have suboptimal control of many cardiovascular risk factors. This study is a prospective, local multi‐centre randomised controlled trial. A total of 150 participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to an intervention arm (group A) and a control arm (group B). The total followup is 12 months. Group A (Intervention arm) Group A will undergo a multifactorial intervention with comprehensive lifestyle and medical program designed to manage cardiovascular risk factors. Intervention in group A is intended to complement standard practice. Multifactorial intervention will occur in the medical clinic setting and can include: Frequent review in a medical clinic Review of blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes with introduction of medications to treat these conditions Smoking cessation program Structured exercise program Weight loss program Obstructive sleep apnoea screening and treatment Procedure Specifics: Medical history and medication review Review by medical physician. Details include: symptoms, past medical history, social history, medication history, and drug allergies and intolerances. If any clinically significant adverse event occurs, in the judgement of the investigator, it will be reported on the adverse event form. It is intended that group A participants are seen mainly by a single medical physician during the study period, to provide continuity of care. Blood pressure management Blood pressure will be measured during clinic review or using a home‐based automated monitor. Group A participants with home‐based monitoring will record values in a journal. Hypertension will be treated with target resting BP less than 130/80 mmHg at least 80% of the time. Participants with hypertension will be monitored with echocardiography to assess for left ventricular hypertrophy progression/ regression. An echocardiogram will be performed at baseline and upon study completion. Lifestyle modification for treatment of hypertension will include dietary salt restriction and/or weight loss program. Pharmacotherapy will be initiated in a stepwise fashion with a preference for angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor antagonists as first line treatment of choice. Lipid Management Serum lipid testing will be performed throughout the study. All participants will be commenced on statin medication, where tolerated. Lipid targets include: LDL less than 1.8 mmol/L and Non‐HDL cholesterol less than 2.6 mmol/L. Treatment of dyslipidaemia will include dietary guidance and escalation of statin therapy to maximum tolerated dose. Additional therapy such as ezetimibe or fibrates may be introduced, where targets are not being met. Weight Management Where a group A participant has a BMI greater than or equal to 27kg/m2, they will be offered a weight management program. The goal will be for a BMI less than 27kg/m2 or at least 10% weight loss. The weight management program will emulate methodology executed in a previous cardiovascular risk factor modification study. Participants will have a structured motivational and goal‐directed program with physician‐led counselling. Meal plans will consist of a calorie‐restricted diet with foods high in protein and a low glycaemic index. In addition, participants will commence a structured exercise program as described below. These participants will be encouraged to maintain a lifestyle journal with documentation of a nutritional intake and physical activities during the week. Weight management will be a priority throughout the duration of the study. Investigators will provide regular feedback and advice to participants via clinic follow‐up and/or email contact. Frequency of contact at discretion of the treating physician. Exercise Therapy Group A participants will be offered an optional structured exercise program that is developed in consultation with an exercise physiologist. This plan is personalised and will consider the motivation and physical limitations of the individual. The program will begin with directly‐supervised exercise therapy, and then a structured home‐based exercise program thereafter. For example: An initial supervised exercise program occurs in an outpatient facility. Subsequently, the participant is counselled and given instructions for home‐based exercise therapy, such as walking, cycling and/or lower limb training. The participant is encouraged to exercise until moderate‐maximum claudication, alternating with periods of rest. The goal is to gradually increase the duration and/or intensity of prescribed activities. The participant logs an activity diary and keeps in regular contact CONDITION: Peripheral arterial disease PRIMARY OUTCOME: The maximum walking distance (MWD) at 12‐months, as defined as the distance the patient can walk on a treadmill (fixed at 2.4km/hour with a 6‐degree incline; up to 15 mins) before they have to stop due to any reason. ; SECONDARY OUTCOME: Berlin Questionnaire score snoring and sleep quality ; Blood pressure measured using sphygmomanometer. ; The outcome will be continuous (specific blood pressure measure) and dichotomous (target met: yes/no).

AB  -  BACKGROUND Post‐operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is defined as a spectrum of postoperative central nervous system dysfunctions both acute and persistent, including subtle neurologic signs and neuropsychological impairment. The incidence of POCD is clearly associated with the age of patients, with older patients being more susceptible to neurologic impairment following anesthesia and surgery. Due to the increasing life expectances and ameliorated surgical and anesthesiologic techniques, more and more elderly people are undergoing surgical procedures. In this respect, POCD is a complication that needs to be taken into account in the perioperative course of elderly patients, especially in those with reduced neurological functional reserve capacity and high prevalence of comorbidities. It is worth underlining that the occurrence of POCD brings a very important subjective burden on the quality of life of the patient and also and outstanding social impact. Several observational studies have shown that POCD occurs in 25% of patients 1 week after the surgical procedure (early POCD) and in approximately 15% of patients at 3 months (late POCD). Importantly, the incidence of POCD at 3 months has been associated to an increased disability and mortality. Post‐operative cognitive dysfunction is probably a multifactorial syndrome, nevertheless 3 principal pathophysiological hypothesis, that certainly could co‐exist, have been formulated: 1. Pharmacological hypothesis: drugs employed during anesthesia can produce alterations in the neuronal network, principally through alterations of the cholinergic transduction signal; 2. Toxic hypothesis: the neuronal damage is a direct consequence of the drugs employed during anesthesia and of the inflammatory mediators associated to the surgical procedure; 3. Hemodynamic hypothesis: hemodynamic changes induced by general anesthesia cause alterations in cerebral blood flow, potentially resulting in ischemic neuronal damage. The present study focuses on the third hypothesis and aims to evaluate the influence of a target of intraoperative arterial blood pressure based on preoperative values on the development of POCD at 3 months after elective non‐cardiac surgery under general anesthesia in patients aged 75 years and older. The present study has a potential high scientific and socio‐economic impact as it could identify a single and quite easily accomplished intraoperative intervention, i.e. a different management of intraoperative blood pressure, that could potentially reduce the incidence of neurological deterioration in elderly patients undergoing general anesthesia for non‐cardiac surgery. Furthermore, it will be the first study investigating a population of patients aged 75 years and more and, to the best of the investigators' knowledge, the first study that will evaluate systematically the possible changes in hearing and vestibular function induced by general anesthesia and surgery. DETAILED RESEARCH PROTOCOL The present study is structured in 3 distinct phases: 1. Preoperative Phase; 2. Intraoperative Phase; 3. Postoperative Phase; 1) PREOPERATIVE PHASE After obtaining informed consent to the study, several evaluations are performed in the Clinic for preoperative anesthesiology evaluation. These include the standard anesthesia evaluation, a geriatric and neuropsychological evaluation and an audiology evaluation. All preoperative evaluations are performed on the same day and in the same place during the normal path followed by outpatients scheduled for elective surgery. Geriatric, neuropsychological and audiology evaluation are always performed in the same sequence. Multidimensional Geriatric Assessment: The multidimensional geriatric assessment includes several tests that allow a global evaluation of the functional status of the patient, including the cognitive domain and the functional performance (ability). The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clock Drawing Test will be used to assess the cognitive state of the patients. The MMSE is usually employed in clinical practice for two reasons: (i) as a quick tool to screen the cognitive status of the patient and (ii) as a tool to track the changes over time in cognitive state of the patients. The MMSE consists of 30 items (questions/tests), that explore different cognitive domains: spatial and temporal orientation, memorization of words, attention, calculation, recall, language and constructive praxis. The score of the MMSE ranges therefore from 0 to 30. A corrected score of ≤ 23 is usually considered suggestive of cognitive decline. The score of the MMSE is corrected for age and education of the patient. The Clock Drawing test (CDT) is an additional test employed to evaluate the global cognitive state of patients and is considered complementary to the MMSE. To perform the CDT the patient is asked to draw a circle in order to symbolize a clock face. Furthermore the patient is asked to draw the watch hands in order to indicate ten past eleven. The test explores the visual‐spatial, practical and executive functions of the patient. The maximal obtainable score is 5/5 and requires the presence of all numbers, drawn in the correct order and close to the border of the clock face, with the correct symmetry and the watch hands correctly showing ten past eleven. The presence of extra numbers, segmentation lines or rotation of the numbers determines the subtraction of 1 point to the score. Scores > 3/5 are considered normal. Functional performance is evaluated employing the scores of the "Activities of Daily Living" (ADL) and the "Instrumental Activities of Daily Living" (IADL), respectively. The ADL are the activities that a person is able to perform independently on a daily basis (eat, dress, wash themselves, move from bed to the chair, use the toilet, etc.). The IADL are the activities that allow a person to live independently in a house or apartment (cook, clean up the house, take medications, use the phone, etc. ). Finally the patients will be characterized in terms of frailty. The geriatric concept of frailty generically indicates a condition of increased vulnerability to stressful conditions, associated to an increased risk of adverse events including falls to the ground, disability, hospitalization and mortality. Physical frailty is defined by the presence of 3 or more of the following criteria: 1. Unintentional weight loss (≥ than 5% body weight loss in the last year); 2. General feeling of exhaustion (subjective, based on questions on the effort in performing certain activities); 3. Weakness as expressed by a reduced handgrip strength, applying different reference values for women and men; 4. Slow walking speed; 5. Low levels of physical activity; The presence of 1 or 2 of these criteria characterizes the so called "pre‐frailty", a condition that is more sensitive to eventual interventions as compared to frailty (3 or more criteria). Finally, patients will be evaluated for "cognitive frailty", which combines physical frailty with the score of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (see below), in order to identify non‐dement patients in whom physical frailty is however associated to an initial cognitive impairment. Patients are classified in 4 different categories: 1. Healthy elderly subjects (no evidence of physical frailty and CDR = 0); 2. Elderly subjects with physical frailty and normal cognitive function (presence of physical frailty and CDR =0); 3. Elderly subjects without physical frailty but with initial cognitive impairment (no physical frailty and CDR = 0.5); 4. Elderly subjects with physical frailty and initial cognitive impairment (presence of physical frailty and CDR = 0.5); The condition of the subjects belonging to group 4 is defined as "cognitive frailty". The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a complex scale performed to quantify the severity of the symptoms of dementia. It includes queries about the cognitive and functional domains. The final score ranges between 0 and 3, with higher scores indicating more severe dementia symptoms. A score of 0.5 is suggestive of the presence of mild symptoms. It is therefore possible that patients with corrected MMSE ≥ 24 have a CDR score of 0.5. Of note, patients included in the study will not undergo the CDR test, as the different items that compose the CDR can be derived from the performed geriatric and neuropsychological test batteries (see below). Neuropsychological Evaluation The cognitive functionality at baseline and its possible worsening after anesthesia/surgery, i.e. the development of POCD, is best evaluated through the administration of neuropsychological test batteries. During the baseline evaluation a neuropsychologist will administer to the patient (or to the subject in the Control group) a battery of tests standardized to evaluate specifically different cognitive domains: memory, attention, language, executive functions, speed of information processing. The obtained raw scores will be corrected for age, gender and education and transformed, according to Italian calibration standards, in standardized scores (Equivalent Scores = ES) on an ordinal scale that ranges from 0 to 4, where 0 represents scores below the cut‐off, i.e., pathological scores, 1 that represents borderline scores and 2,3 and 4 which characterize normality. The duration of the administration of the test battery is approximately 35 minutes. At 3 months and 1 year from the surgical procedure/general anesthesia (or from baseline evaluation in the Control group) the same test battery will be repeated. In those tests having a parallel version, the parallel version will be administered, in order to reduce the learning effect. The difference in scores of the tests performed at 3 months (and 1 year) and baseline, corrected for the mean difference observed in the Control group in the same timeframe, will be used in order to define the occurrence of POCD. Patients in whom the difference (worsening) in the global score at 3 months to the global score at baseline will be greater than 2 standard deviations from the expected difference, i.e., the mean difference between the two evaluations (baseline and 3 months) observed in the Control Group, will be diagnosed with POCD. Moreover, changes in raw scores of the different tests will be considered with the purpose of identifying possible changes in specific cognitive domains. The administered neuropsychological tests will be the following: ‐ Trail Making Test: evaluates the visual‐motor coordination and speed and task‐switching skills by assessing someone's ability to follow a simple number sequence (Trails A) and a more complex sequence of alternating numbers and letters (Trails B). ‐ Stroop test: evaluates selective attention, executive functions, the inhibition of distractions and cognitive flexibility. ‐ Symbol Digit Modalities Test: evaluates sustained attention, with elements of vigilance and working memory. ‐ Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test: measures anterograde visual and verbal memory skills. ‐ Verbal Phonemic Fluency Test: measures the capacity of access to verbal vocabulary and is considered a marker of pre‐frontal functionality. ‐ Denomination test: evaluates the capacity of visual access of vocabulary. These tests have a score and a cut‐off value that allows to categorize the result as normal, i.e., that falls within the average results obtained from a control group of healthy subjects matched for age, gender and education, or pathological, i.e., below this average value. Audiology Evaluation The audiology evaluation will include the following tests: video oculography, pure tone audiometry, disyllabic speech audiometry and speech audiometry with verbal tasks and motor responses. Video oculography analyzes the function of the oculomotor system through the study of saccadic eye movements and optokinetic system. It allows to identify an alteration at the level of the brainstem, cerebellum or of both structures. Saccadic eye movements are rapid, ballistic eye movements, which subserve vision by redirecting the visual axis to a new location, i.e., to direct the fovea onto an object or region of interest that appeared in the periphery of the field of view. Saccadic eye movements represent the majority of eye movements and the control signal of saccadic eye movements is the so‐called "retinal error". Collected parameters during the study of saccadic eye movements include: Latency: this is the time taken from the appearance of a target to the beginning of a saccade in response to that target; Peak Velocity: this is the highest velocity reached during the saccade. Saccade velocity profiles are usually symmetrical at least for small and medium size saccades. In some conditions while the size of saccades remains reasonably accurate, the saccade velocity is greatly reduced ‐ so‐called slowed saccades; Precision: relation between angular displacement of the eye and the displacement of the reference target; The "optokinetic reflex" causes eye movement in response to objects moving in the periphery while the head is stationary and is extremely important for stabilizing the image of visual input on the retina and provides for primary control of this capacity when the head is stationary. It is composed by a slow phase (SP), directed toward the movement of the panorama, and a quick phases (QP) with opposite direction. These movements have similar characteristics to saccadic eye movements. Collected parameters during the study of optokinetic nystagmus include the slow‐phase velocity of optokinetic nystagmus, which is dependent upon the speed of the stimulus, gain, expressing the percentage of the ratio between the speed of the slow phase of nystagmus and the speed of the stimulus, asymmetry, indicating the difference in gain between the two sides. Pure tone audiometry aims at defining quantitatively and qualitatively the possible occurrence of hearing loss, its entity and site of the lesion. Pure tone audiometry is performed through the aid of an audiometer and headphones. This study is performed to investigate the functionality of the peripheral auditory system. Finally, disyllabic speech audiometry and speech audiometry with verbal tasks and motor responses will be performed, using controlateral masking (cocktail party noise). These evaluations investigate the comprehension of verbal stimuli and numerically quantify the ability to repeat disyllabic words. It also evaluates the semantic comprehension of phrases and the ability of the subject to follow simple motor commands. These tests, taken together, evaluate both the functionality of the peripheral hearing apparatus and the cortical integration of peripheral signals. Considered parameters are the comprehension of the verbal message (100% represents full understanding) and the sound intensity level at which comprehension is maximal, expressed in decibels hearing level (dB HL). Another parameter studied during speech audiometry testing is the percent reduction of disyllabic words understood as the sound intensity increases. This phenomenon, the reduction of understood disyllabic words with increasing sound intensity, is due to pathologic distortion of cochlear and retro cochlear structures (VIII cranial nerve). Anesthesiology Evaluation The anesthesiology evaluation will be performed as standard clinical practice in preparation for surgical procedures under general anesthesia. This evaluation will include: physiologic, pathologic and drug history collection, clinical examination including peripheral saturation of oxygen by pulse‐oximetry (SpO2), resting heart rate and non‐invasive blood pressure measurement with an automatic sphygmomanometer. Three measurements of resting blood pressure will be performed during the visit and the mean value of the three measurements of mean blood pressure will represent the baseline mean arterial blood pressure of the patient 2) INTRAOPERATIVE PHASE. The day of the operation the patient will be randomized to one of two groups, Treatment or Standard of Care (see below). Vital functions will be recorded once the patient is in the operating room, before induction of anesthesia, and throughout the entire duration of the surgical procedure and anesthesia up to extubation or transport to the post‐operative intensive care unit. Parameters recorded will include blood pressure (either invasive or non‐invasive, depending on clinical need), heart rate, peripheral saturation of oxygen, end‐tidal concentration of carbon dioxide, ventilator parameters, drugs and fluid administered, fluid balance and blood loss. Additional measurements will be performed when available: non‐invasive cardiac output (Nexfin/Pulsioflex, Edwards Lifesciences), non‐invasive cerebral oximetry through near‐infrared spectroscopy (INVOS, Covidien) and depth of anesthesia through bispectral index (BIS) measurement (Bispectral Index Technology, Covidien). The anesthesiologist will be responsible for the clinical management of the patients assigned to the two arms. Violations of the protocol are possible whenever the anesthesiologist judges it clinically necessary. ‐ Standard of Care Group: intraoperative hemodynamic management will be left to the discretion of the anesthesiologist, without any indication as to the intraoperative hemodynamic strategy to be adopted. Of note, baseline mean arterial pressure (as measured during the preoperative evaluation) will not be communicated to the anesthesiologist in care. ‐ Treatment Group: in this group the anesthesiologist will have as hemodynamic target the maintenance of mean arterial blood pressure within 10% of the baseline mean arterial blood pressure value. The modalities to reach this target (quantity and type of drugs, quantity and type of intravenous fluids, positioning of the patient etc.) will be left to the clinical judgment of the anaesthesiologist. All interventions will be recorded. The intraoperative protocol requires the acquisition of hemodynamic, respiratory, and all the other parameters already described at pre‐defined intervals (anesthesia induction, start of surgery, every 30 minutes thereafter, end of surgery, extubation/transport to post‐surgical ICU). At the end of the operation the blood pressure recording of the entire duration of general anesthesia will be downloaded from the anesthesia monitor and analyzed offline with a dedicated software to quantify exactly the time spent in each category (mild, moderate or severe, see below) of hypotension or hypertension. Any hypotensive or hypertensive episode will be classified as mild, moderate or severe based on the worst mean arterial blood pressure recorded during the episode, according to the following cut‐offs. Mild: mean arterial blood pressure 10‐20% of baseline mean arterial pressure; Moderate: mean arterial blood pressure 20‐40% of baseline mean arterial pressure; Severe: mean arterial blood pressure < or > 40% of baseline mean arterial pressure. 3) POSTOPERATIVE PHASE. DELIRIUM During the first postoperative week all patients will be evaluated, on a daily basis, for delirium occurrence by the CAM‐ICU scale (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit). POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS Length of stay in the ICU (if applicable), length of stay in the hospital and any postoperative complication will be recorded. Cardiac, respiratory, renal, neurologic and hemorrhagic complications will be assessed. Cardiac complications Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values (preferably cardiac troponin, cTn) with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit and with at least one of the following: ‐ symptoms of ischemia; ‐ new or presumed new significant ST‐segment‐T wave (ST‐T) changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB); ‐ development of pathological Q waves in the ECG; ‐ imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality; ‐ identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy. Congestive heart failure: at least one of the following clinical signs (i.e. elevated jugular venous pressure, respiratory rales/crackles, crepitations, or presence of S3) and at least one of the following radiographic findings (i.e. vascular redistribution, interstitial pulmonary edema, or frank alveolar pulmonary edema). Pulmonary embolism: any one of the following: 1. A high probability ventilation/perfusion lung scan 2. An intraluminal filling defect of segmental or larger artery on a helical CT scan 3. An intraluminal filling defect on pulmonary angiography 4. A positive diagnostic test for deep vein thrombosis (e.g., positive compression ultrasound), acute cor pulmonale at cardiac ultrasound and one of the following: A. non‐diagnostic (i.e., low or intermediate probability) ventilation/perfusion lung scan B. non‐diagnostic (i.e., subsegmental defects or technically inadequate study) helical CT scan Cardiac arrest: documented or presumed ventricular fibrillation, sustained ventricular tachycardia, asystole, or pulseless electrical activity requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, pharmacological therapy, or cardiac defibrillation. Atrial fibrillation: new atrial fibrillation that results in angina, congestive heart failure, symptomatic hypotension, or that requires treatment with a rate controlling drug, antiarrhythmic drug, or electrical cardioversion. Neurologic complications Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic): new focal neurological deficit thought to be vascular in origin with signs or symptoms lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death. Renal complications Acute kidney injury is defined by an increase in serum creatinine of more than or equal to 1.5 times the baseline (preoperative) value or more than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl. Hemorrhagic complications Mild hemorrhage: decrease of Hb levels < 3 g/dl without hemodynamic impact, without need for surgical revision or endovascular intervention; conservative treatment (transfusion of 2‐3 red blood cells units and fluid infusion); Severe hemorrhage: decrease of Hb levels > 3 g/dl with hemodynamic impact (tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria etc); transfusion of more than 3 red blood cells units; need for surgical revision or endovascular treatment. POSTOPERATIVE COGNITIVE EVALUATION Patients At 3 months ± 2 weeks and 1 year ± 2 weeks after the surgical intervention, patients will undergo the same geriatric, neuropsychological and audiology evaluations described in the "Preoperative Phase" section. Subjects of the Control Group Subjects enrolled in the Control group will undergo the same evaluations (geriatric, neuropsychological and audiology) described in the "Preoperative Phase" section and to the same evaluations after 3 months ± 2 weeks and 1 year ± 2 weeks. These subjects will not undergo any surgical procedure and will therefore not be evaluated for post‐operative complications or delirium occurrence. STATISTICS Sample size calculation. Primary outcome measure: The incidence of POCD is around 15% in patients aged over 70 years. Despite the lack of data in patients aged 75 years and more (the average expected age is around 80 years in this population), the investigators estimate an incidence of 20%. Hypothesizing that the proposed intervention (intraoperative arterial blood pressure target) could cause a 25% relative reduction in the incidence of POCD (from 20% to 15%) the sample size, for a probability of type I error α=0.05 and a power (1‐β) = 0.8 is of 1812 patients. Of note, at the enrolment of 906 patients the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will perform an ad interim analysis. Secondary outcome measures: ‐ Delirium: the incidence of delirium in very old patients undergoing general anesthesia is around 15%. The sample size foreseen for the primary outcome measure (1812 patients) provides a power (1‐β) = 0.88 with α = 0.05 to detect a 30% relative reduction in this secondary outcome measure. ‐ Incidence of POCD at 1 year: the incidence of POCD in patients over 70 years of age, at 1 year after surgery is estimated to be 16%. In the very old, given the lack of data in literature, the investigators estimate that the incidence could be around 20%, therefore similar to the incidence of POCD at 3 months after surgery. The sample size foreseen for the primary outcome measure (1812 patients) provides a power (1‐β) = 0.8 with α = 0.05 to detect a 25% relative reduction in this secondary outcome measure. ‐ Hearing and vestibular dysfunction: There are not sufficient data in the literature to estimate the incidence of this secondary outcome measure. It is therefore not possible to estimate the statistical power. Design and Pilot Study This is a multicentre international prospective parallel‐group double‐blind (patients and outcome assessors) randomized controlled trial. Currently two Centres are involved (Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy and Universitätsmedizin Göttingen (UMG), Göttingen, Germany). Other Hospitals will be involved after the enrolment of the first 100 patients (Pilot study). The first 100 enrolled patients will be included in a formal pilot study in order to evaluate the feasibility of the study and estimate the real incidence of POCD at 3 months in this study population. These patients will be randomized, and the minimization criterion will be applied, similarly to the other patients (see below). Of note, these patients will be included in the final analysis. Randomization Patients will be randomized on the day of the surgical procedure through the use of a dedicated software. Considering the known risk factors for POCD (advanced age, major surgery and low level of education), the minimization criterion will be applied to the randomization. Minimization allows to randomize each new patient enrolled in the study in order to minimize the differences between the two allocation arms for the risk factors considered. This means that when a new patient enters the study, the patient's own characteristics for the risk factors considered will affect the patient's probability to be enrolled in one of the two allocation arms. The minimization criterion allows to reduce unbalancing for known risk factors between the allocation arms of the study. The criteria for minimization will be the following: ‐ Age class: 75 ≤ age < 80; 80 ≤ age < 85; age ≥ 85 ‐ Foreseen duration of the surgical intervention: < 2 hours; ≥ 2 hours ‐ Education level (years of scholarity): 0‐8 years; 9‐13 years; >13 years Control Group Two hundred and fifty subjects will be enrolled in the Control Group; 30 subjects will be included in the pilot study. Considering the rule of thumb that requires a minimum sample size of 120 for the study of reference intervals, the proposed sample size of 250 seems definitely adequate. Nevertheless, the pilot study will allow to have a clearer view of the application of the parametric method. The sample size of the control group could therefore be resized based on preliminary data from the Pilot Study. Statistical analysis The analysis of continuous variables will be performed via Student's t‐test, one or two way analysis of variance (depending on the characteristics of the analysis). The study of association between continuous variables will be performed through linear regression methods keeping in consideration possible non‐linear effects. The analysis of non‐categorical variables will be performed with contingency tables through the use of Fisher's exact test and Chi‐square test, together with appropriate indicators of association. P<0.05 will be considered as significant. A detailed statistical analysis plan will specify the phases of the analysis in relation to the objectives of the research protocol. Publications deriving from this research protocol will present data according to the current recommendations on parallel‐group randomized controlled trials involving non‐pharmacological treatments. The primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated according an Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis, furthermore results will be evaluated according to the effective adherence to the study protocol ("Per Protocol" Analysis). Finally, the following pre‐specified and subgroups analysis will be performed: ‐ Total hypotensive time vs. primary and secondary outcome measures; ‐ Mild, moderate and severe hypotensive time vs. primary and secondary outcome measures; ‐ Analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures related to minimization categories (age classes, education level, major vs. minor surgery); ‐ Analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures according to the occurrence of intraoperative cerebral desaturation episodes according to values recorded with the INVOS. ‐ Analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures in the subgroup of patients with hypertension and in patients with diagnosis of "cognitive frailty".

AB  -  INTERVENTION: A 6‐month exercise program with either continuous exercise or a combination of high‐intensity training combined with continuous exercise training. The 1‐year follow‐up randomized control trial is performed with participants randomly allocated to one of the three groups: HIIT (a combined program that includes HIIT and MICT), MICT (a standard exercise prescription) or control (no exercise prescription). The allocation ratio is 1:1:1, and randomization is performed by a web‐based randomization system following the baseline evaluation. Age, sex and diagnosis (stroke or TIA) are controlled in the randomization. The HIIT intervention involves an exercise program consisting of three weekly aerobic sessions including a combination of HIIT performed under clinical supervision at the university kinesiology clinic and MICT sessions performed at home. The choice of a combination program was to create a realistic exercise program that can be used in a clinical setting so that patients would not always be dependant on clinical supervision. Therefore, the program is designed to enable participants’ autonomy by reducing supervision over time. HIIT is done on an ergocycle and includes several bouts at 95% of peak power output (PPO) interspersed with a 60‐sec recovery. Time at 95% of PPO progresses from 30‐sec to 60‐sec. Exercise time progresses from 20 to 40 minutes over the intervention and is adjusted according to the participant’s tolerance and the progress of the protocol. Participants are asked to perform their MICT sessions at home. MICT includes 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at a moderate intensity determined by participants’ perceived exertion. The MICT intervention consists of an exercise program involving th CONDITION: Ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack ; Circulatory System ; Cerebral infarction, unspecified PRIMARY OUTCOME: Cardiorespiratory fitness measured with peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) at the university hospital. The GTX protocol was performed on a semi‐recumbent ergocycle with 12‐lead ECG monitoring (MAC 5500HD, GE Healthcare, USA). The cadence was maintained at 60 rpm; power started between 0 watts and 60 watts depending on the participant’s capacity and increased progressively by 10 watts per minute. These tests were performed at baseline (T0) after the 6‐month intervention (T6), and after 12 months (T12) at the university or hospital. SECONDARY OUTCOME: ; Measured at baseline (T0) after the 6‐month intervention (T6), and after 12 months (T12):; 1. Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured twice on each arm with the participant in a sitting position. The result was the average of the two measures taken with an automated sphygmomanometer (HEM‐907XL, Omron IntelliSense, USA) in accordance with the recommendations of the Canadian Education Hypertension Program.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: E02.186 E02.760.169.063.500.387 G11.427.590.530.698.277 Low‐cost physical exercise programs will be implemented in or around the partner UBS. The intervention will be performed for 6 months (24 weeks), twice a week (on non‐consecutive days), with sessions lasting approximately 60 minutes, 40 minutes of aerobic or coordination exercises, preceded and completed by 10 minutes of stretching. Three groups will participate in this project (30 participants per group): 1) aerobic group (GA); and 2) aerobic group with high motor complexity (coordinative) (GAC) and 3) monitoring group (control).  1) The GA will only perform continuous walking exercises for 40 minutes being preceded and completed by 10 minutes of stretching around the unit or public space (squares, sports courts, soccer field or parks). The training intensity will be between 12 and 14 points on Borg's subjective stress scale (approximately 70‐80% FC).   2) The GAC will only perform exercises that challenge challenging coordination for 40 minutes being preceded and completed by 10 minutes of stretching at UBS or in public spaces around it. The training protocol will be developed using general physical activities (various displacements), displacements with alternating movements of limbs in phase, antiphase and out of phase, unstable bases, inclusion of elements such as balls and disks, addition of companions to perform combined tasks , addition of external attentional focus (eg obstacles, paths, external rhythm). The development of the session will take place with 10 exercises (stations) with predominance of coordinating activities, being carried out in circuit format. The rest interval between each station will be 30 seconds. The training intensity will be between 12 and 14 points on the subjective Borg stress scale (approximately 70‐80% FC) and the time of each season will be 70 seconds. 3) The monitoring group (control) will be evaluated in 2 moments as the variables of interest (0 and 24 weeks) without receiving any intervention. At the end o CONDITION: Recurrent depressive disorder; Recurrent depressive disorder, unspecified; Other depressive episodes. ; F33 ; F33.9 ; F32.8 PRIMARY OUTCOME: Average difference of 6 points on the Depression Rating Scale Montgomery‐Asberg ‐ MADRS in favor of physical exercise groups.; SECONDARY OUTCOME: Cognitive function: ; ; Front evaluation battery, Processing speed, Function and memory ‐ 10% increase in performance in favor of physical exercise groups.; ; ; MOca ‐ Increase of 2 points in favor of physical exercise groups; ; ; Stroop test ‐ decrease in 2 seconds in the execution of the test in favor of physical exercise groups. ; ; The Frontal Evaluation Battery [36] is a brief tool designed to evaluate executive functions. This instrument takes approximately 10 minutes to administer its six items: (i) similarities (conceptualization) ‐ explores abstract reasoning by presenting pairs of objects of the same semantic category; (ii) lexical fluency (mental flexibility) ‐ evaluates self‐organization, strategy and change, generating as many words as possible beginning with a certain letter; (iii) series of engines ‐ explores scheduling and engine planning by running the Luria (palm side) series; (iv) conflicting instructions ‐ exploits the sensitivity to interference, giving the opposite response to that of the examiner; (v) go / no‐go ‐ evaluates inhibitory control and impulsivity; and (vi) grip behavior ‐ evaluates the ability to spontaneously inhibit grip. A maximum score of 18 is obtained by adding the score to each of the six items, which are scored between 0 and 3. Each of the six items evaluates different cognitive and behavioral domains involved in different neural networks. ; ; The Trail A and B test was proposed in the mid‐last century [37] to assess visual tracking, attention, mental flexibility and motor function [71]; They were used to assess the effect of physical exercise on executive functions [24]. It consists of two sections (A and B): circles with numbers (1‐25) (Session A) and numbers (1‐13) and letters (A ‐ L) (session B). The evaluator should draw lines with a pencil or pen to connect the circles in an ascending pattern (Session A) and increasing pattern, but performing the alternation between numbers and letters (that is, 1‐A‐2‐BC‐3, etc.). ‐ Session B). Tests should be performed as fast as possible without lifting the pen or pencil from the paper. The score is obtained as the time (seconds) spent to complete sections A and B. The higher the value in these two variables, the worse the participant's performance. ; The RAVLT was originally developed by Andre Rey [38] and has become one of the most used memory evaluations, with a translated, adapted and standardized version in Portuguese [72]. It consists of two lists of 15 nouns (A and B) and a list of words of distraction. The list of words A is read 5 consecutive times (A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5) and immediately after each reading, the patient should repeat the words he remembers. Subsequently, list B is read and the patient again must repeat the words they remember (B1). After reading list B, the patient should verbalize the remembered words from list A (A6). After an interval of 15 minutes, the patient must identify himself in a list of 30 words from list A (A7). ; ; The digit‐symbol substitution test [39] consists of filling as many empty boxes as possible, using a symbol that corresponds to a number. The end time is 90 seconds. The strategy to solve the substitution of the digit symbol requires speed of response, sustained attention, visual spatial skills and cognitive alternation [73]. The test application form shows the nine symbols with the corresponding numbers (1 to 9). The subject must write the numbers corresponding to each symbol whenever it is presented to him (up to 120 situations). Performance is measured by the number of successes in the 90‐second period, with scores ranging from 0 (worst performance) to 120 points (best performance). ; ; MoCA [40] is a screening tool for cognitive impairment (0 to 30 points) and evaluates 7 cognitive domains: visual and executive function (5 points), commitment (3 points), attention (6 points), language ), abstraction (2 points), late recall (5 points) and orientation (6 points). Recent evidence suggests that MoCA can also be used to observe changes in cognitive function following physical exercise interventions in different populations [74‐77]. ; ; The Stroop test [41] uses three cards containing 24 stimuli each and a white background. Card A is composed of rectangles printed in green, pink, blue and brown, randomly arranged. Card B is organized similarly to Card A, but with rectangles replaced by undefined words with color concepts (each, never, today and all) printed in capital letters in the four colors mentioned. Card C was also organized similarly to Card A, representing the interference card in which the written stimuli were the name of the colors (brown, blue, pink and green), printed in the same colors in such a way that the color of the ink and color name never combined (for example, brown word printed in pink, green or blue). For the first card participants must indicate the colors of the rectangles as soon as possible. For cards B and C, subjects should indicate the quality of printed words and not read. Evaluation of cost with treatment: a reduction of US $ 10.00 in cost per patient treated in favor of physical exercise groups.; ; ; The cost with the treatment of each patient will be investigated by the methodology described by Codogno. At the end of the experimental period, considering the demand for services that were recorded in the medical records in the 6 months of the intervention period. The following information will be obtained: medicines supplied to the patient, laboratory tests performed and the number of consultations, back to the period of beginning of the intervention. In addition, taking into account that patient costs involve administrative and maintenance services of the BHUs where the procedures are performed, the costs related to the maintenance and administration of the BHUs studied (cleaning, maintenance, administration, among others) will be added, In order to do so, the values ??stipulated for the maintenance of these services as well as the number of patients attended, both analyzed according to daily information, will be added to the costs above each patient, according to the number of days he spent By UBS's in the six‐month period. ; In order to transform the procedures into currency, the values ??informed by the Municipal Health Department, for the year 2017, will be used. ; The costs for implementing the interventions (aerobic group and coordination group) will also be accounted for, taking into account the materials / equipment used as well as the time and financial resources spent by the professionals involved, which will allow the analysis of the intervention with better cost‐effectiveness. Evaluations of cardiovascular risk factors ; Global cardiovascular score: 10% increase in performance in favor of physical exercise groups.; ; ; The Brazilian Cardiovascular Prevention Directive recommends the use of the global cardiovascular score as an indicator of cardiovascular risk. For its calculation it is necessary to check the variables HDL‐C (high density lipoprotein cholesterol), SBP (systolic blood pressure), CT (total cholesterol), in addition to information whether the individual is a smoker or not and the presence or absence of diabetes . ; Metabolic syndrome: The metabolic syndrome is characterized by the grouping of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, type 2 diabetes / glucose intolerance, central obesity and dyslipidemia (LDL‐cholesterol, high triglycerides and HDL‐cholesterol Low), epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that regular physical activity is an important factor for the prevention and treatment of this disease, which supports our proposal to follow up on this variable. ; Total body composition and follow‐up ‐ The portable electronic scale with four‐pole bioimpedance (Imbody 270; Biospace, Seoul, Korea) will be used to measure total and follow‐up body composition (lean mass and fat mass). ; Height: To measure height measurements, stadiometers (Sanny, São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, Brazil) will be used, with a scale in tenths of centimeters. ; Waist circumference: Measurements of waist circumference (at umbilical scar height) will be performed using an anthropometric tape (Sanny, São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, Brazil). Standardized technical protocols will be used in these assessments. ; Diagnosis of Hypertension ‐ Blood pressure will be measured three times in each arm after five minutes of rest with the individual in the sitting position. This procedure will be repeated in two days, using a mercury column sphygmomanometer and considering phases I and V of the Korotkoff sounds for the identification of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively. The mean of six measured values ??in each arm will be calculated and the mean obtained in the arm with the highest blood pressure will be considered for the analysis. ; Blood analysis: For analysis of total cholesterol and fractions, and blood glucose will be performed blood collection through peripheral puncture of the forearm vein, after overnight fasting for 12 hours. Approximately 20 mL of blood will be collected in tubes containing EDTA. The blood will be centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 ° C. The plasma will then be stored in eppendorf plastic tubes and stored at ‐80 ° C for further analysis. ; Functional tests: 10% increase in performance in favor of physical exercise groups; ; ; ; Linear spatial variables of gait will be assessed using three inertial sensors (GaitUp, Physilogs®, Switzerland) in which the participants will walk 15m. These sensors encompass a micro‐controller, memory, 3‐axis accelerometer (range ±3 g), gyroscope (range ±800° s?1) and battery comprising a small (50 mm × 37 mm × 9.2 mm) and lightweight (19 g) module, which is attached to the leg with an elastic Velcro strap. These sensors will measure step length, gait speed, cadence, and percentage of oscillation and were previously validated to assess gait pattern in older adults [46, 47]. The participants will perform three trials on a 15m walkway on three different conditions: (i) single task (only walking); (ii) dual task words (walking and speaking words); (iii) dual task subtractions (walking and serial‐3 subtractions). ; ; The TUG test [48] is one of the most used to verify the functionality of the elderly. The patient will be timed while he or she rises from a chair (seat height 46 cm), walk as quickly as possible at a comfortable and safe pace to a line on the floor 3 m away from the chair, turn and walk back to the chair, and sit down again. Time will be recorded from the instant the patient’s buttocks leave the chair (standing up) until the next contact with the chair (sitting down). Before the test, the patients will perform two familiarization attempts separated by least 1 min. After the familiarization trials, two test trials will be performed with an 1‐min interval between trials (37). The shortest time will be used for analysis. ; ; The TUG cognitive test [49] will be identical to the TUG, but individuals will perform cognitive tasks (subtractions) during the test. The patients will say the results of serial‐3 subtractions starting with different numbers [49] to eliminate any training effect. The shortest time will be used for analysis. ; ; The handgrip strength will be assessed by a hand dynamometer used in clinical practice. The instrument has two parallel handles, one fixed and the other movable. This instrument has a closed hydraulic system that measures the amount of grip strength when producing an isometric contraction of the hand muscles. Results will be recorded in kilograms. Patient's position will follow the guidelines of the American Society of Hand Therapists [50], which is positioning the shoulder slightly adducted, the elbow flexed at 90 °, and the forearm in neutral position. The handle can range from 0 ° to 30 ° in extension. Three trials will be performed on two separate days (test and retest ‐ minimum interval of 48 hours). The best performance between the two days will be considered for analysis. ; ; Body compostion ; The total and segmentar fat will be assessed using a portable electronic balance with bioimpedance (Inbody 230; Biospace, Seoul, Korea). The stature will be measured using a fixed stadiometer (Sanny, São Paulo, Brazil) with an accuracy of 0.1 cm. Weight and height values will be used to calculate the BMI [weight (kg) / height (m) 2]. Measurements of hip and waist circumference will be taken with the use of an anthropometric metal tape with precision of 0.1 cm. All anthropometric measures will be performed following the standardization described by Freitas Jr. et al., (2001) [52]. ; Increased 10% of brain derived neurotrophic peripheral factor (BDNF) in favor of physical exercise groups.. Scale of suicidal ideation and quality of sleep: 10% increase in performance in favor of physical exercise groups.; ; ; The Scale Columbia of Suicide score distinguishes suicidal ideation from suicidal behavior. There are 4 subscales: severity of ideation (score of 0‐5), intensity of suicidal ideation (score of 0‐5), behavior that is a nominal scale that evaluates actual, aborted, interrupted attempts; and self‐injurious behavior (with no intent to commit suicide), and the fourth is the lethality of the actual attempts (scale score 0‐6) [42]. ; ; The Scale of Hopelessness score compares hopelessness in the future, which presents a greater chance of developing several mental disorders and an indicator of suicide risk. It's a dichotomous scale with 20 items with affirmations of '' right '' or '' wrong. '' The total score is 20 points (minimum 0‐4, mild 5‐8, moderate 9‐13, severe 14‐20) [43]. ; ; The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is a tool widely used for research and practice regarding psychiatric disorders [44]. This questionnaire interprets the perception of sleep quality, being quite feasible, and reliable [44, 78]. The overall index is composed of seven components: subjective sleep quality (perception of sleep quality of subjects), sleep latency (time between lying on bed and start sleep), duration of sleep (period sleeping reported by the individual , sleep disturbance (sleeping problems), sleep medication (use of sleeping medications) and diurnal dysfunction (daytime sleepiness intensity). Each of the seven components is scored from 0 (no difficulty for the component of interest) to 3 (very bad). The scores on these components are combined to generate a global score that reflects sleep quality and disturbances over a 1‐month period. The overall score ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating lower sleep quality. In addition, subjects were dichotomized into "poor" sleepers (> 5) and "good" sleepers ( <5) according to an earlier methodology [79]. ; ; The BRIAN is a self‐report questionnaire that was originally developed and validated in individuals with bipolar disorder to provide an index of circadian biological rhythm disturbance [45]. This scale considers sleep interruptions, irregularities in social rhythm, eating patterns and abnormalities in daily activity at home and at work in the last 15 days, all of which were postulated to contribute to the onset and worsening of affective episodes, as well as psychosocial function and clinical outcomes [80‐83]. BRIAN is able to differentiate into mood states of unilateral and bipolar euthymic depression [81, 83] (Faria et al., 2015, Pinho et al., 2015), and is also an independent predictor of psychosocial functioning, depression severity, and quality of life [83‐85]. The questionnaire includes 18 items divided into 4 domains of the circadian biological rhythm: sleep (5 questions), activity (5 questions), social (4 questions) and food pattern (4 questions). Each question is scored in four‐point subscales, with scores ranging from 1 (no difficulties in maintaining the usual pace) to 4 (serious difficulties in maintaining the usual pace), totaling a minimum and maximum overall score of 18 and 72, respectively. Higher scores indicate a greater rupture of the circadian biological rhythm. The chronotype is also captured by BRIAN, in which the last three items address the individuals' daily preference for work and sociability, if they feel more productive in the morning, and if they feel that their day and night cycle has been reversed in the last year. Three questions about circadian preference evaluate the morning and evening chronotypes: "Do you have more energy for work and interpersonal relationships at night?" (Active at night), "Do you feel more productive in the morning?" (Active in the morning) and "Have you reversed your day / night cycle?" (Reverse day / night cycle). The options are: never (1), rarely (2), often (3), always (4). A low score indicates a morning preference and a high score indicates a night preference [86]. ; INCLUSION CRITERIA: Have a diagnosis of major depressive episode (single or recurrent episode by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), evaluated by a psychiatrist‐trained evaluator; use of pharmacological treatment for mental health (use of anxiolytic drugs or antidepressants); did not participate in a systematic exercise program in the last 6 months and be able to perform systematic physical exercise (medical authorization); be over 40 years of age; do not have chronic degenerative diseases, dementias (score <23 in the Mini Mental State Examination), joint or muscle injuries that prevent him from carrying out systematized physical exercises.

AB  -  Participants: For this study, 16 adult males with overweight or obesity (BMI‐range 28 ‐ 36 kg/m2) were recruited and randomized in two experimental groups (high intensity training (n=8) and continuous moderate‐intense aerobic training (n=8)). Randomization was done with the envelope method. Participants were excluded if they had diabetes (HbA1c>6,5%), severe musculoskeletal (eg osteoarthritis), cardiovascular (eg chronic heart failure) or respiratory (eg chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) problems, based on medical files A signed informed consent was provided by all participants before study admission. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Ghent University Hospital (B670201318620). Intervention: The intervention group performed a high intensity interval training [HIIT]. The HIIT group followed a 10‐week training program. The participants exercised for 40 minutes, twice a week, under supervision of two physiotherapists. Each training session included a warming up [stretching of the large muscle groups and cardiovascular exercises at 30% of peak cycling power output for five minutes], a sprint interval block [10 minutes], continuous aerobic exercise [10 minutes], another sprint interval block [10 minutes] and cooling down [stretching of the large muscle groups and cardiovascular exercises at 30% of peak Watt for 5 minutes]. For the first 5 weeks, each sprint interval block consisted of 10 sprint bouts [>100 r/min] of 15 seconds at a cycling resistance matching with the ventilatory threshold [VTR], alternated with 45 seconds relative rest [50 r/min at VTR]. Starting from week 6 until week 10, the intensity of sprinting and relative rest was increased up to 110% of VTR. Comparative group: The comparative group performed a continuous aerobic training [CAT] for 10 weeks, twice a week and 40 minutes per session [volume and frequency is equal to HIIT]. The protocol of the CAT group consisted of warming up [stretching of the large muscle groups and cardiovascular exercises at 30% of peak cycling power output for five minutes], continuous aerobic exercise training [3 times 10 minutes] and cooling down [stretching of the large muscle groups and cardiovascular exercises at 30% of peak cycling power output for five minutes]. During the continuous aerobic protocol [cycling or stepping] participants exercised for 10 minutes at a HR similar to the HR at VT [60 r/min], which was increased to 110% of VT from week 6 onwards. The training was supervised by two physiotherapists. In both exercise modes the participants cycled in the first and third block and cycled or stepped in the second block. The training programs were conducted in the Physiotherapy Department of the University Hospital of Ghent. Outcome variables: The quantification of all examined variables was performed by blinded assessors. All tests and measurements were conducted at the exercise laboratory of the Physiotherapy Department, Ghent University (maximal exercise test, metabolic flexibility) or at the Department of Endocrinology University Hospital Ghent (OGTT and muscle biopsy) or Department of Pathological Anatomy (muscle histology). Prior to all tests and measurements, participants were well informed and familiarized with the equipment and testing protocols. All participants from each group were tested on the same moment of day pre‐ and post‐intervention. All participants maintained normal physical activity and dietary patterns, and refrained from exhaustive physical exercise three days prior to each experimental day Anthropometry Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a stadiometer (Holtain Ltd, Pembrokeshire, UK). Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on a digital balance scale (Seca, Germany) with the subject wearing lightweight clothing and no shoes. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated from weight and height. Physical fitness Maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. Participants were tested on a computer‐driven cyclo‐ergometer (Marquette Case, Marquette Electronics, Milwaukee, WI, USA) using a ramped protocol (20 W/ min) starting at 40 W. Twelve‐lead electrocardiogram and heart rate (HR ) were recorded continuously during the test, whereas blood pressure was measured with a manual sphygmomanometer every two minutes. Subjects were familiarized with the test procedure before baseline testing. Subjects were asked and encouraged to perform exercise testing until physical exhaustion or until the physician stopped the test because of severe adverse events, such as increasing chest pain, dizziness, potentially life threatening arrhythmias, clinically important ST‐segment deviations, marked systolic hypotension or hypertension. Tests were classified as maximal when respiratory exchange ratio (RER) increased above1.1. Respiratory gas measurements were obtained by using a Metalyzer 3B (Cortex, Leipzig, Germany). Oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), minute ventilation (VE), tidal volume, respiratory rate and mixed expiratory carbon dioxide concentration were measured continuously with mixed chamber analysis. Peak VO2 was expressed as the highest attained VO2 during the final 30 seconds of exercise according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines. The ventilator threshold (VT) was determined based on the metabolic equivalents of O2 and CO2 (VE/VO2 and VE/VCO2). The point at which the VE/VO2 increased without an increase in VE/VCO2 was identified as the VT. Basal respiratory exchange ratio Participants had to lie supine for 30 minutes after an overnight fast in a quiet and thermo‐neutral environment. Basal oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production was measured with an automated respiratory gas analyzer using a mask (Metalyzer 3B; Cortex, Leipzig, Germany). The gas analyzer system was calibrated before every experiment. RER was calculated as VCO2/VO2. This ratio lies in an interval between 0,7 en 1,0 indicating dominant fat oxidation to dominant carbohydrate oxidation. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) At 8:00 A.M. , after a 10‐ to 12‐h overnight fast, subjects received a 75‐g OGTT. Blood samples were taken at ‐30, ‐15, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min for the measurement of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Insulin levels were determined using the immunoanalyzer COBAS e411 (Roche). Glucose was analysed by the hexokinase method (COBAS, Roche). To evaluate insulin sensitivity an OGTT‐composite score was calculation based on the reference of Matsudoa et al.. This score is composed as 10,000/square root of (fasting glucose x fasting insulin) x (mean glucose x mean insulin during OGTT). The higher the score, the better the insulin sensitivity. Muscle biopsy After a 1‐h rest period, a percutaneous needle biopsy sample was taken from the right vastus lateralis muscle with a biopsy gun (needle 14G) under local anesthetic through a 2‐mm incision in the skin (2‐3 ml lidocaine) under the guidance of echography. Two muscle samples of 15 mg were taken and incubated in PG (Paraformaldehyde and Glutaaraldehyde) for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM was used to determine IMCL and mitochondrial characteristics. Samples were viewed at 6,500× using a JEOL 1200EX TEM. Sixteen micrographs were acquired from 8 randomly sampled longitudinal sections of muscle fibers (2 micrographs/fiber) from each individual muscle ‐ one micrograph acquired near the cell surface representing the subsarcolemmal (SS) region and the other acquired of parallel bundles of myofibrils representing the intramyofibrillar (IMF) region. Lipid droplets and mitochondrial fragments were circled and converted to actual size using a calibration grid. For each set of 16 images, mean IMCL or mitochondrial size (µm2), total number of IMCL droplets or mitochondria per square micrometer of tissue (#/µm2) were calculated in the IMF and SS compartments by digital imaging software (Image Pro Plus, ver. 4.0; Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, MD). The reference for SS space quantification was the cytoplasmic space between the sarcolemma and the first layer of myofibrils. Statistical analyses All data were analysed with a commercially available statistical software program (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, SPSS 20.0, SPSS Chicago, IL, USA). Data are expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD). Due to the small sample size a non‐parametric statistical evaluation was preferred. To evaluate pre‐post differences within groups, a Wilcoxon test was performed. To evaluate pre‐post differences between groups, differences between pre‐ and post‐evaluation were calculated (pre minus post) and compared with a Mann Withney U test. Significance levels were set at P<0,05 for both tests. For the between group differences effect sizes were calculated based on Cohen's d values.

AB  -  Introduction Many epidemiological studies have shown that serum cholesterol levels are strongly related to cardiovascular risk [1, 2]. Consequently lowering cholesterol levels is a fundamental prognostic goal in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. The 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl‐coenzime A (HMG‐CoA) reductase inhibitors, commonly known as "statins" are at the forefront of strategies to manage hypercholesterolemia, especially in patients at high or very high risk of cardiovascular diseases, in view of their established efficacy in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in both primary and secondary prevention [3, 4]. However, 10‐15% of patients result to be intolerant to any statins, even at low daily doses and almost one‐third of statin users discontinue therapy within one year from the beginning [4, 5]. Furthermore, the use of statins to reduce cardiovascular risk in clinical practice is rarely encouraged for primary prevention and some other patients, especially in primary prevention, refuse statins because of the fear of possible side effects. Some nutraceutical products may represent an alternative treatment to be considered for the above mentioned cases, above all in patients with marginally high hypercholesterolemia [4, 6]. Since the use of full‐ dose nutraceuticals entails some tolerability concerns, a combination of nutraceuticals with different but synergic mechanisms of action at lower and safer dosages could be preferable. In particular, in recent years there has been a growing interest in a nutraceutical combination containing monakolin (the biologically active component of red yeast rice), berberine and policosanols (MBP‐NC). The cholesterol lowering effect of MBP‐NC consumed in conjunction with a standard Mediterranean healthy diet has been observed in a large Italian study carried out by general practitioners (GPs) [7], in patients intolerant to more than one statin [8], in patients with metabolic syndrome or who are overweight [9, 10] and in elderly hypercholesterolemic subjects [11]. Moreover, MBP‐NC mixture has been reported to have some direct protective vascular effects, similar to pharmacological lipid lowering agents, such as improvement in endothelial dysfunction [12] and improvement in aortic stiffness [13]. Another recent study has reported that a 2‐month treatment with MBP‐NC improved insulin sensitivity in patients with metabolic syndrome [14]. However, hitherto the cholesterol lowering effect of MBP‐NC has not been evaluated in long term double‐blind placebo controlled studies. The aim of this single centre, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a 24 week treatment with MBP‐NC mixture in low ‐moderate risk hypercholesterolemic patients. Materials and Methods Population A cohort of 66 consecutive outpatients with newly diagnosed primary hypercholesterolemia not previously treated who applied to the Lipid Clinic of the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Siena (Italy), were considered for enrolment in this study. The inclusion criteria were (1) age between 18 and 60 years , (2) body mass index(BMI) between 18,5 ad 29,9 Kg/m2, (3) serum low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) above 150 mg/dL and an estimated 10‐year cardiovascular risk < 20% according to Framingham risk scoring. The exclusion criteria were (1) history of cardiovascular disease or coronary risk equivalents, (2) secondary hyperlipidemia caused by diabetes mellitus, renal, liver or thyroid diseases, (3)alcohol consumption of > 40 g/day, (4) estimated 10‐year cardiovascular risk > 20% according to Framingham risk scoring, (5) muscular diseases or abnormally elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels or drug treatment with anti‐platelet, anti‐inflammatory, hypolipidemic agents or hormone replacement therapy, either on‐going or any time in the previous 2 months. Instead, the patients on stable anti‐hypertensive treatment for at least 3 months were included. All the patients were instructed to maintain their habitual physical activity during the study period. At the screening visit, all patients were instructed to follow a hypolipidic diet (low‐ cholesterol/ low‐saturated fat diet approximately consisting of 55% carbohydrates, 20% proteins, and 25% lipids) during a run‐in period of 3 weeks, after which all patients who met the inclusion criteria, were randomized to receive a pill of MBP‐NC (N=30 ) or placebo (N=30) once a day after dinner, in addition to the hypolipidic diet. The placebo pills, identical in taste and appearance to the MBP‐NC pills, consisted of inactive compound. Randomisation and blinding were provided by Rottapharm Madaus S.p.A (Monza, Italy). The composition of the patented proprietary combination of nutraceuticals investigated was as follows: red yeast rice extract 200 mg (equivalent to 3 mg monacolins), berberine 500 mg, policosanol 10 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme Q10 2 mg and asthaxantin 0.5 mg (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm Madaus S.p.A, Italy). The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2000 and 2008, and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Siena. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Clinical and anthropometric evaluation All patients underwent physical examination at baseline and after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. All the determinations were made at the Lipid Clinic at 09.00 AM , after an overnight fast of 12 h. Height and weight were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 Kg, respectively. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height squared in meters. Brachial blood pressure was measured by a physician with a mercury sphygmomanometer after patient had been seated for at least 10 min and the average of 3 measurements was considered for the analysis. Waist circumference was also measured at each visit midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest using an anthropometric tape. In all patients, body composition [fat mass (FM) percentage, fat‐free mass (FFM) and fat‐free mass/fat mass ratio (FFM/FM)] was assessed by anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) using a single‐frequency 50 kHz bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA 101 RJL, Akern Bioresearch, Florence, Italy). All BIA measurements were carried out by the same operator according to the standard tetrapolar technique, with patients in a supine position for at least 20 min. The electrodes were placed on the dorsal surface of the right foot and ankle and the right wrist and hand. Biochemical measurements In all patients fasting venous blood samples were drawn at baseline and after 4, 12 and 24 weeks in order to assess serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C). All lipid parameters (TC, TG, HDL‐C and LDL‐C) were measured using a colorimetric method (Autoanalyzer Menarini, Florence, Italy). In order to monitor the safety of the MBP‐NC in all patients, at the same time points, serum levels of glucose, uric acid, CPKw, gammaglutamiltranferase (ɣGT) and transaminases were also assessed. Tolerability was monitored by recording symptoms. Medication compliance was assessed by counting the number of pills returned at the clinic visits.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: The objective of this research is to determine whether health technologies can be utilised in specialist chronic disease clinics to deliver lifestyle interventions to improve the management of cardiometabolic risk in individuals with complex chronic conditions. There will be two groups; an intervention group and a control group randomised to a 1:1 ratio. Intervention: ‐ Participants will undergo education for increasing physical activity in line with Australian National Guidelines (30minutes daily, up to 150minutes per week of aerobic and resistance activity) and aligning with heart healthy dietary eating patterns. The Healthy heart dietary education will focus on increasing intake of fruit/veg/wholegrains/healthy proteins, reduction of foods with added salt/sugars and promotion of healthy fat choices such as nuts and olive oil). Education is focused on food choice and dietary pattern with no specific education around weight reduction even though weight loss may occur as a result of dietary change. The intervention will last for 26 weeks. All intervention participants will receive a one‐on‐one baseline dietary assessment and education session with an accredited practicing dietitian. The first session will be one‐on‐one for the health professional to determine any individual specific needs, but all remaining appointments will be group base and delivered via telehealth or technology assisted contact such as online information or text messages. Participants will receive an information booklet and then can choose a range of review strategies including group video 1hr dietitian review (offered monthly), group video 1hr exercise sessions (offered weekly), text message support with frequency from 1 ‐ 3 per week to reinforce advice, information, motivation and s CONDITION: Cardiometabolic Health;Solid Organ Transplant Recipients;Chronic Kidney Disease;Metabolic Syndrome; ; Cardiometabolic Health ; Solid Organ Transplant Recipients ; Chronic Kidney Disease ; Metabolic Syndrome Cardiovascular ‐ Other cardiovascular diseases Diet and Nutrition ‐ Obesity Metabolic and Endocrine ‐ Other metabolic disorders Physical Medicine / Rehabilitation ‐ Other physical medicine / rehabilitation PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcome will evaluate the feasibility of technology assisted patient‐led lifestyle interventions to inform future implementation of this model of care into usual practice assessed at the end of the 26‐week program as a composite of: ; ; 1. Recruitment and refusal rate: ; Recruitment rate will be measured as the number of patients recruited from the pool of eligible patients referred to dietetics and invited to participate within a 6 month recruitment period. Refusal rate will be recorded with descriptive demographic data such as age; aeitiology of primary diagnosis; time post transplant (if applicable); gender; location and reason for refusal if participant is willing to disclose. ; 2. Retention rate: ; Study retention will be calculated as the inverse of attrition (due to drop‐out or safety concerns) at 26 weeks in both study groups. Retention will also explore the demographics and clinical characteristics of those participants that drop out compared to those remaining in the trial.; 3. Exposure demand, uptake and adherence to dietary and physical activity interventions:; Exposure demand: Due to the nature of patient choice embedded into the intervention, the range of exposure to the intervention delivery across the participant groups will be documented. This will include capturing the range of combinations of request to access technology to support health behaviour change including number and frequency of text messages requested, number of group telehealth diet and exercise appointments booked. This will be used to determine whether people in the target population are interested in health technologies to assist with lifestyle change. ; Participant uptake: For each of the optional group exercise and dietary education sessions offered and online content, number of participants who sign up for group sessions and number of views of online content will be measured and their demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected to inform intended uptake. ; Adherence rates: The proportion of those who sign up for each optional group exercise and dietary session will be matched against attendance at each telehealth group exercise and dietary session. ; 4. Safety:; The safety of the intervention will be monitored and any study‐related serious adverse events of interest (cardiac, orthopaedic, musculoskeletal) including hospitalisation, symptom development or injury will be recorded and compared to the control group. ; ; The criteria for safety and feasibility have been chosen based on a thorough review of feasibility studies in the literature, the desire for non‐inferiority outcomes from current usual care and the need for sustainability if this model of care was to be rolled out in real world practice. ; ; Feasibility success will be determined if it is safe and if 2 or more of the feasibility criteria are met:; Safety defined as:; • The proportion of study‐related serious adverse events in the intervention group is similar to the control group. ; ; 2 or more of these criteria to be met; Recruitment rate: ; • >/= 50% of all eligible patients are recruited;; Retention rate:; • >/= 70% of intervention participants complete the study ; Exposure demand, uptake and adherence to dietary and physical activity interventions:; • Group exercise and dietary sessions each have attendance of at least 80%.; • >/= 75% of participants in the intervention group receive higher frequency of health professional contact compared to average number of contacts in control group; [week 0 and week 26] SECONDARY OUTCOME: Confidence: Likert scales of patient’s perception of confidence in managing their diet and exercise will be measured. [Week 0 and Week 26] Dietary Quality: Dietary data collected using the research version of the Easy Diet Diary phone app (Research Food Diary) and analysed in FoodWorks (version 10). This data will be used to compare dietary quality of both groups at baseline and post intervention as measured by dietary intake changes from baseline in serves per day of (i) core food groups (fruit, vegetables, meats and alternatives, dairy and alternatives, and grains and cereals); (ii) fibre; and (iii) discretionary food [Week 0 and Week 26] Fatigue will be measured using the FACIT fatigue scale version 4[Week 0 and Week 26] Participant satisfaction and acceptability (mixed method) Using semi‐structured interviews with a subset of purposively sampled intervention participants ; [Week 26] Physical Activity and Physical Function: The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) long form survey will be used to measure habitual physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Weekly time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity will be measured by a wearable activity monitor. Physical function will be determined by functional tests: sit‐to‐stand, grip strength and 6‐min walk tests, measured by a trained health practitioner. [Week 0 and Week 26] Quality of Life will be measured using the EQ‐5D‐5L Quality of life questionnaire[Week 0 and Week 26] Sleep quality and quantity will be measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) survey and collection of sleep data from the wearable activity monitor (total minutes awake, minutes of REM sleep, minutes of light sleep, minutes of deep sleep and an overall sleep quality score rated out of 100)[Week 0 and Week 26] The economic analysis will evaluate an estimate of costs related to development and delivery of the intervention will be captured to provide a healthcare provider perspective, as well as a patient perspective based on the estimated impact of the intervention on food costs: will include changes to total costs, assessed by healthcare utilisation (hospital admissions, appointments with specialist, GP and allied health) and implementation costs ; • Intervention development: including programming of the software and technical staffing. ; • Intervention delivery: Information on health care resource use associated with the intervention will be collected, including the cost of the telehealth‐delivered coaching (training, call duration, call attempts, phone call cost, SMS, overheads), cost of automated SMS system, staff time, and software required. ; Participants will be asked to record any health care utilisation in a diary (provided at week 0) during the course of the study which will be returned at week 26 and reviewed at week 26 across both groups. ; [Week 26] The secondary outcomes will evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the program on reducing cardiometabolic risk, and the economic impact of the program. The outcomes will be assessed using the following measures: ; 1. Clinical Effectiveness ‐ assessed at baseline (pre‐randomisation) and repeated at 26 weeks ; • MetS Severity Score A MetS Severity Score based on clinical thresholds from an Australian population, will be calculated ‐ This is a z‐score calculated as continuous risk assessment score. MetS severity score is calculated using the five parameters of the MetS including: waist circumference (measuring tape to nearest 0.5 centimetre), systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured as mean of three assessments with automatic sphygmomanometer with 1 min rest in between measures, fasting serum triglycerides, HDL‐cholesterol and glucose. The score calculated gives an indication of MetS status compared to others. A score below 0 indicates a lower degree of MetS than the average adult, a score close to 0 indicates an average degree of MetS. Scores over 0 are associated with greater risk for future disease and scores >1 indicate high prevalence MetS. ; [week 0 and week 26] INCLUSION CRITERIA: Participants will be considered eligible when they meet the following INCLUSION CRITERIA: a) Aged greater than or equal to 18 years b) Under the care of at least one of the following Princess Alexandra hospital specialist clinics (liver, renal) or under the care of the Ipswich hospital chronic kidney disease clinic; c) Have at least one of the following features of MetS: hypertension, obesity (by BMI >30kg/m2 or central obesity), dyslipidemia (raised fasting triglyceride or low HDL cholesterol), raised fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes; d) Screened as safe to exercise unsupervised; e) Deemed medically suitable to participate by their treating specialist; f) Have current access to a phone/mobile device or computer hardware with internet access and capabilities for webcam attachment; and g) Provide written informed consent.

AB  -  The World Health Organization estimates that smoking is one of the leading causes of premature death worldwide with an estimated 5‐8 million lives lost annually due to tobacco usage (1). Heated tobacco products (HTP) is a new form of tobacco products. HTP usually consists of a pod with tobacco that is mixed with glycerol which is inserted into a heating chamber. HTP is not combusted but only heated (2). Previous studies into smoking cessation with regular cigarettes and electronic cigarettes have suggested a risk for double usage instead of cessation, augmenting a nicotine addiction (3‐5). There is a risk that HTP use simply enhances nicotine usage and smoking addiction. There is limited data on the health effects of HTP. A majority of the studies available have reported conflicts of interest to manufacturers of HTP (11). It has been shown that aerosols from HTP contain toxic compounds and free radicals just as in regular cigarette smoke, albeit in lower concentrations (6‐8). Furthermore, aerosols from HTP can spread in a room, enabling passive exposure (9). It has been shown that there is a decrease in harmful biomarkers in smokers that switch to HTP after 5 days of usage but also of a higher HTP consumption compared to regular smoking (12). There are few studies on effects of HTP in humans. Nabavizadeh et al has shown impaired endothelial function in rats after exposure to IQOS (10). _____________ Subjects and criteria: Thirty male or female occasional tobacco users (age 18‐40, maximum 10 cigarettes per month or 10 pouches of snus per month) will be included. They have to be healthy, having no preexisting conditions or take any medications. All subjects will have to complete a normal health declaration. Methods: In randomized cross‐over fashion subjects will either inhale vapor (1 puff per minute for 30 minutes, total 30 puffs) from a HTP of the brand IQOS (IQOS 3 Multi, Philip Morris AB) or perform sham‐smoking of HTP. Measurements of arterial stiffness is performed previous, during and 60 minutes following exposures. Blood samples will be collected at baseline for cotinine, measurement with T‐TAS, endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), NETs and extracellular vesicles (EV). Blood samples will be drawn up to 3 hours post‐exposure (EPC, T‐TAS,EV, NETs). Microcirculation is evaluated at baseline with skin capillaroscopy and Laser‐Speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) and at 1 hour post‐exposure. Measurement of vascular function Arterial stiffness (Sphygmocor) Increased arterial stiffness is recognized as a major factor in vascular aging and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (13). Arterial stiffness will be assessed by pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity. Photopletysmography (PPG) Finger photoplethysmography is another method that provides information on the arterial bloodflow which allows measurement of pulse propagation time (PPT) (14). Measurement of microcirculation Microcirculation will be assessed by several methods. Skin perfusion is investigated through Laser Speckle contrast Imaging , which is an optical technique for assessment of skin flux, i.e movement of circulating red blood cells. This method measures overall skin flux in superficial arterioles, capillaries and venules over wide skin areas and with a high frequency. Iontophoresis is a non‐invasive method for drug application across the skin using a small electric current. Acetylcholine (ACh, Sigma‐Aldrich AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA), both diluted in 9% physiological sodium chloride solutions, are used to investigate endothelium‐dependent and endothelium‐independent microvascular reactivity, respectively. Electrode chambers (LI611 Drug Delivery Electrode, Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) are attached to the volar side of the left forearm, avoiding hair, broken skin and visible veins, and filled with a small volume of either ACh (2%) or SNP (2%). A battery‐powered iontophoresis controller (Perilont LI 760; Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) provides a single dose of 0.02 mA for 200 seconds for drug iontophoresis. ACh is delivered using an anodal charge and SNP with a cathodal charge. LSCI (PeriCam PSI NR; Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) is used to assess skin microvascular flux continuously before, during and 15 minutes after iontophoresis. Skin capillaroscopy is another method for evaluating the microcirculation. A USB microscope (CapillaryScope 500 pro, Dino‐Lite®) is used to visualize nail fold capillaries in the finger (preferably 4th digit of left hand). Capillaries with good optical signals, i.e. with visible red blood cell movements and plasma gaps, are chosen for examination. Capillary blood flow is registered continuously at rest, during and after one‐minute arterial occlusion at the proximal phalanx of the digit with a suprasystolic cuff pressure. Calculation of capillary blood cell velocity (CBV, mm/s) is done off line and will generate following four variables: rCVB (mean CBV at rest), pCVB (peak CBV following one‐minute arterial occlusion), time to peak (time (s) from release of cuff pressure to peak flow, and post‐occlusive reactive hyperemia (precentral increase of CBV from rest to peak flow). Blood pressure: A semi‐automatic oscillometric sphygmomanometer will be used to measure blood pressure and heart rate. Blood sampling Blood samples will be drawn into test tubes containing 1/10 0.129 M sodium citrate, EDTA and serum at baseline, at 2 hour and 4 hours after exposure. Plasma is later collected after centrifugation at 2 000g for 20 min in room temperature (RT) and then frozen at ‐70°C until analysis. Measurement of thrombus formation (T‐TAS) T‐TAS® (Total Thrombus‐formation Analysis System) is a means of assessing thrombus formation during variable flow conditions using a small blood sample. Measurement of cotinine Measurement is done to ensure adherence that subjects have not used tobacco in the last 7 days. Levels of cotinine will be measured in serum using a commercial available ELISA technique. Measurement of EPCs The number of EPCs will be measured in whole blood by flow cytometry. EPCs are measured as CD34+ KDR+ (KDR: vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) double positive cells. Briefly, 20 µl of whole blood is incubated with CD34‐FITC (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and CD309 (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA). Conjugate isotype‐matched immuno‐globulin (IgG1‐FITC, IgG1‐PE) with no reactivity against human antigens are used as a negative control. After 30 minutes of incubation in a dark environment, BD cell‐fix is added to fixate the samples. Twenty thousand events of leukocytes are collected (based on classical forward scatter/side scatter (size/granularity) characteristics of blood leukocytes) and results will be presented as a number of EPC events. Measurement of Extracellular Vesicles Plasma is thawed and centrifuged at 2000g for 20 minutes at RT. The supernatant is then re‐centrifuged, at 13 000g for 2 minutes at RT. 20 µl of sample is incubated for 20 minutes in dark with phalloidin‐Alexa‐660 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), lactadherin‐FITC (Haematologic Technologies, Vermont, USA), CD42a‐PE (Platelet‐MP (PMP), BD, Clone Alma‐16), CD45‐PC7 (Leukocyte‐EV (LEV), Beckman Coulter, Dublin, Ireland) and CD144‐APC (Endothelial‐EV (EEV), AH diagnostics, Stockholm, SWE). PEVs are also labeled with CD154‐PE (CD40L, abcam, Cambridge, UK) and EEVs with CD62E (E‐selectin, Beckman Coulter, Dublin, Ireland). EVs are measured by flow cytometry on a Beckman Gallios instrument (CA, USA). The EV‐gate is determined using Megamix beads (BioCytex, Marseille, France), which is a mix of beads of with diameters of 0.5 µm, 0.9 µm and 3.0 µm, respectively. EVs are defined as particles less than 1.0 µm in size, negative to phalloidin (in order to exclude cell membrane fragments) and positive to lactadherin. Conjugate isotype‐matched immunoglobulin (IgG1‐FITC, IgG1‐PE, IgG1‐APC and IgG1‐ PC7) with no reactivity against human antigens is used as a negative control to define the background noise of the cytometric analysis. The absolute number of EVs is calculated by means of the following formula: (EV counted x standard beads ⁄ L) ⁄ standard beads counted, (FlowCount, Beckman Coulter). __________________ References 1.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: The IDEAL‐EX Project will compare the effect of combined high‐intensity interval training (HIIT) and progressive resistance training (PRT) against HIIT alone for improving cardiometabolic risk factors in older adults, over 12 weeks of exercise. Both groups will attend UNSW Sydney Exercise Physiology department and receive individually supervised exercise sessions, 3 non‐consecutive days a week over 12 weeks by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist with at least 5 years experience. The HIIT+PRT group will perform 20 minutes of HIIT, as outlines below, including warm up and cool down, followed by 4 high‐intensity PRT exercises (approximately 30 minutes as outlined below). The HIIT group will perform 20 minutes of HIIT, including warm up and cool down, and be instructed to avoid PRT during the intervention. Interventions Frequency: 3 training sessions per week, non‐consecutive days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) HIIT: Intensity: Warm‐up and cool‐down 50‐60% peak heart rate (PHR), Interval=85‐95%PHR, Rest ~70%PHR Type: Cycle ergometer Time: 20 min (Warm‐up: 4 min, Intervals: 2x4min, Recovery: 2x3min, Cool‐down: 2 min) Progression: Commence the 1st exercise session in Week 1 with only 1 interval at 75%PHR. From the 2nd exercise session onwards, the 2nd interval will be added and maintained. Intensity progressed by 5% resistance or Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) each session to ensure 85‐95%PHR attained. Volume for HIIT: HIIT (frequency x intensity x time) PRT Type: Power training. Pin‐loaded weight plate machines. Leg press, leg curl, seated row, chest press Intensity: 80% 1 Repetition Maximum (1RM) Volume: 3 x 8 Repetitions Pattern: Fast concentric and slow eccentric phase. Rest 1 min between sets Time: Approx 30 min Pr CONDITION: Cardiometabolic Risk; ; Cardiometabolic Risk Cardiovascular ‐ Hypertension Metabolic and Endocrine ‐ Metabolic disorders Physical Medicine / Rehabilitation ‐ Other physical medicine / rehabilitation PRIMARY OUTCOME: Handgrip strength ; The primary outcome is the difference in handgrip strength between groups at the end of the intervention period. This be assessed using a handgrip dynamometer. [Hand Grip strength will be assessed at 3 time points: baseline (week ‐1), midway through the intervention (week 6) and at the end of the intervention (week 13). Measurements will also be repeated fortnightly for progression of the intervention, but these measures wonâ€™t be used as outcomes. ] Muscle strength; The primary outcome is the difference in muscle strength between groups at the end of the intervention period. Lower limb muscular strength will be assessed via a 1 repetition maximum (RM) leg press and knee extension on a pin‐loaded machine, with maximum loads lifted added together for lower limb strength. Upper limb strength will be assessed via a 1RM seated row and chest press pin‐loaded machine, with maximum loads lifted added together for upper body strength. This is a composite primary outcome of whole body strength, which will be calculated by adding the lower body and upper body 1RM strength measures together. Handgrip strength will also be assessed using a dynamometer. These exercise tests will be repeated at baseline sessions 1 and 2 (at least 2 days apart) to account for the learning effect evident in muscle strength testing and the highest value used to represent baseline strength in analysis. ; [Whole body muscle strength will be assessed at 3 time points: baseline (week ‐1), midway through the intervention (week 6) and at the end of the intervention (week 13). Measurements will also be repeated fortnightly for progression of the intervention, but these measures wonâ€™t be used as outcomes. ] SECONDARY OUTCOME: Blood Pressure. ; Resting blood pressure will be assessed via a validated automated sphygmomanometer; exercising blood pressure will be measured during the VO2peak exercise test at 3‐minute intervals by a Finapres. ; [Resting blood Pressure will be taken prior to each exercise session to ensure participant safety. It will also be assessed as an outcome at 3 time points: baseline (week ‐1), midway through the intervention (week 6) and at the end of the intervention (week 13).] Body Composition (adipose/visceral fat distribution and lean muscle mass) ; Body composition will be assessed via Dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) measured in both kg and % total body mass. ; [Body Composition (adipose/visceral fat distribution and lean mass) will be assessed at 2 time points: baseline (week ‐1) and at the end of the intervention (week 13).] Body Mass Index (BMI) ; Weight will be measured using a digital scale with the person fasting, barefoot and dressed only in underwear and a surgical gown. The gown will be weighted and the weight of which will be subtracted from the person's body weight. Height will be measured using a SECA wall mounted statiometer with the person barefoot and in the hospital gown. BMI will then be calculated using the following formula: weight (kg) divided by height (in metres) squared. ; [BMI will be assessed at 3 time points: baseline (week ‐1), midway through the intervention (week 6) and at the end of the intervention (week 13).] Cardiorespiratory fitness. ; Cardiorespiratory fitness, measured as peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak in ml/min/kg), will be assessed by a validated maximal graded cycling exercise test on a cycle ergometer with a Medgraphics metabolic cart and electrocardiograph, conducted by an AEP. ; [Cardiorespiratory fitness will be assessed at 3 time points: baseline (week ‐1), midway through the intervention (week 6) and at the end of the intervention (week 13).] Cardiovascular Disease risk will be calculated using the ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus (http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD‐Risk‐Estimator‐Plus/#!/calculate/estimate/) will be used to estimate patientâ€™s 10‐year ASCVD risk. The calculator uses the following information: Current Age (years), Sex (male/female), Race (White/African American/Other), Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg), Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg), Total Cholesterol (mg/dL), HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL), LDL Cholesterol (mg/dL), History of Diabetes (Yes/No), Smoker (Current/Former/Never), On Hypertension Treatment (Yes/No), On a Statin (Yes/No) and On Aspirin Therapy (Yes/No).[ASCVD Risk will be calculated at baseline (week ‐1) and week 13 using venous blood samples.

Finger prick testing using the Cardiocheck will be completed at 3 time points: baseline (week ‐1), midway through the intervention (week 6) and at the end of the intervention (week 13). ] Perceived Physical Activity ; The Active Australia Survey will be used to assess perceived participation in various types of physical activity as well as establishing awareness of current public health messages about physical activity.[Active Australia Survey will be assessed at 2 time points: baseline (week ‐1) and at the end of the intervention (week 13).] Physical Activity Enjoyment ; The enjoyment of physical activity will be measured using the physical activity enjoyment scale.[Physical activity enjoyment will be assessed at 2 time points: baseline (week ‐1) and at the end of the intervention (week 13).] Pulse wave velocity ; The difference in arterial stiffness, measured by pulse wave velocity in m/s. Pulse wave velocity will be assessed with the SphygmoCor pulse wave analysis system while the participant is lying supine on a bed. Blood pressure will be taken in the arm and then the pressure sensor will be placed on the carotid, radial, femoral and dorsalis pedis arteries to obtain the pulse wave velocity data.[Pulse wave velocity will be assessed at 2 time points: baseline (week ‐1) and at the end of the intervention (week 13).] Quality of life ; Quality of life (including 8 sub scales of physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health) will be assessed using the Short Form (SF)36 v2 Survey.[SF36 will be assessed at 2 time points: baseline (week ‐1) and at the end of the intervention (week 13).] Self‐Efficacy ; Ewartâ€™s Physical Exercise Self‐Efficacy Scale will be used to assess self‐efficacy.[Self‐efficacy will be assessed at 2 time points: baseline (week ‐1) and at the end of the intervention (week 13).] Sleep Quality ; Sleep quality will be measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (including its subscales of 7 components).[Sleep quality will be assessed at 2 time points: baseline (week ‐1) and at the end of the intervention (week 13).] Total Cholesterol ; Venous blood samples will be collected at baseline Week ‐1 and post‐test Week 13, aliquoted for plasma, stored at UNSW at ‐80Â°C awaiting analysis of all samples together by the Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry Analyser at completion of the trial. Baseline Week‐1, Week 6 and Week 13 finger prick blood sample will be analysed by the Cardiochek PA Analyser. Total cholesterol will be measured in mmol/L.[Total Cholesterol will be assessed via venous blood sampling at baseline (week ‐1) and week 13. Finger prick testing using the Cardiocheck will be completed at 3 time points: baseline (week ‐1), midway through the intervention (week 6) and at the end of the intervention (week 13). ] Triglycerides ; Venous blood samples will be collected at baseline Week ‐1 and post‐test Week 13, aliquoted for plasma, stored at UNSW at ‐80Â°C awaiting analysis of all samples together by the Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry Analyser. Baseline Week‐1, Week 6 and Week 13 finger prick blood sample will be analysed by the Cardiochek PA Analyser. Triglycerides will be measured in mmol/L.[Triglycerides will be assessed via venous blood sampling at baseline (week ‐1) and week 13. Finger prick testing using the Cardiocheck will be completed at 3 time points: baseline (week ‐1), midway through the intervention (week 6) and at the end of the intervention (week 13). ] Waist Circumference. ; Waist circumference will be measured in cm according to International Diabetes Federation/American Heart Association (IDF/AHA) guidelines, midway between the lowest ribs and the iliac crest.[Waist circumference will be assessed at 3 time points: baseline (week ‐1), midway through the intervention (week 6) and at the end of the intervention (week 13).] INCLUSION CRITERIA: Participants will be eligible if they are 65 years or older and have two or more modifiable biological cardiometabolic disease risk factors. The following classifications/definitions of cardiometabolic disease risk factors will be used (as per the most recently updated international guidelines from the American Heart Association and International Diabetes Federation): â€¢ Body Mass Index greater than or equal to 25.0 kg/m2 â€¢ Waist Circumference greater than or equal to 94 cm (Male); greater than or equal to 80 cm (Female) (or population‐specific guidelines) â€¢ Systolic Blood Pressure BP > 120mmHg and Diastolic Blood Pressure > 80 mmHg â€¢ Fasting Blood Glucose greater than or equal to 5.6 mmol/L â€¢ Total Cholesterol greater than or equal to 5.2 mmol/L â€¢ Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than or equal to 2.6 mmol/L â€¢ High‐density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than or equal to 1.0 mmol/L (Male); greater than or equal to
