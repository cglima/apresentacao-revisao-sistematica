TI  - Relaxation therapy and continuous ambulatory blood pressure in mild hypertension: a 
      controlled study.
PG  - 1368-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the long term effects of relaxation therapy on 24 hour 
      ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure in patients with mild untreated and 
      uncomplicated hypertension. DESIGN: Four week screening period followed by 
      randomisation to receive either relaxation therapy or non-specific counselling for 
      one year. Ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure was measured before and after 
      treatment. SETTING: Outpatient clinic in Amsterdam's university hospital. SUBJECTS: 
      35 Subjects aged 20-60 who were being treated by general practitioners for 
      hypertension but were referred to take part in the study. At three consecutive 
      screening visits all subjects had a diastolic blood pressure without treatment of 
      95-110 mm Hg. Subjects were excluded if they had damaged target organs, secondary 
      hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a cholesterol concentration greater than 8 mmol/l, 
      or a history of malignant hypertension. INTERVENTIONS: The group allocated to 
      relaxation therapy was trained for eight weeks (one hour a week) in muscle 
      relaxation, yoga exercises, and stress management and continued exercising twice 
      daily for one year with monthly visits to the clinic. The control group had the same 
      attendance schedule but had no training and were requested just to sit and relax 
      twice a day. All subjects were asked not to change their diet or physical activity. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Changes in ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure after one 
      year of relaxation therapy or non-specific counselling. RESULTS: Mean urinary sodium 
      excretion, serum concentration of cholesterol, and body weight did not change in 
      either group. Diastolic pressures measured by sphygmomanometry were 2 and 3 mm Hg 
      lower in subjects in the relaxation group and control group respectively at the one 
      year follow up compared with initial readings. The mean diastolic ambulatory 
      intra-arterial pressure during the daytime had not changed after one year in either 
      group, but small treatment effects could not be excluded: the mean change for the 
      relaxation group was -1 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -6 to 3.9 mm Hg) and for the 
      control group -0.4 mm Hg (-5.3 to 4.6 mm Hg). Mean ambulatory pressure in the 
      evening also had not changed over the year, and in both groups nighttime pressure 
      was 5 mm Hg higher. The variability in blood pressure was the same at both 
      measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Relaxation therapy was an ineffective method of lowering 
      24 hour blood pressure, being no more beneficial than non-specific advice, support, 
      and reassurance--themselves ineffective as a treatment for hypertension.

TI  - Relationship between blood pressure measured in the clinic and by ambulatory 
      monitoring and left ventricular size as measured by electrocardiogram in elderly 
      patients with isolated systolic hypertension.
PG  - 269-76
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the additional diagnostic precision conferred by ambulatory 
      blood pressure monitoring on clinic blood pressure measurement in evaluating the 
      severity of isolated systolic hypertension. METHODS: The association between left 
      ventricular size as determined by ECG voltages [R-wave voltages in lead V5 (RV5) and 
      S-wave voltages in lead V1 (SV1)] and blood pressure as assessed by clinic 
      measurements and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was studied in 97 elderly 
      patients included in the placebo run-in phase of the Syst-Eur trial. The additional 
      diagnostic precision conferred by ambulatory monitoring on clinic blood pressure 
      measurements was assessed by relating the residual ambulatory blood pressure level 
      to the ECG-left ventricular size. The residual ambulatory blood pressure level was 
      calculated by subtracting the predicted ambulatory blood pressure level for each 
      patient (using the linear regression equation relating both techniques for the 
      group) from the observed ambulatory blood pressure. RESULTS: Clinic systolic blood 
      pressure was on average 20 mmHg higher (P < 0.001) than daytime ambulatory blood 
      pressure while diastolic blood pressure was similar with both techniques. The sum of 
      SV1 + RV5 was significantly related to clinic systolic pressure (r = 0.25), and 24-h 
      (systolic, r = 0.37; diastolic, r = 0.29), daytime (systolic, r = 0.30; diastolic, r 
      = 0.19) and night-time (systolic, r = 0.33; diastolic, r = 0.28) ambulatory blood 
      pressure levels. These findings were not affected by adjustment for gender, age and 
      the body mass index. The sum of SV1 + RV5 was significantly related to the residual 
      24-h (systolic, r = 0.30; diastolic, r = 0.31), daytime systolic (r = 0.20) and 
      night-time (systolic, r = 0.31; diastolic, r = 0.29) ambulatory blood pressure 
      monitoring levels. CONCLUSION: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring adds to the 
      diagnostic precision of clinic blood pressure measurement in assessing the severity 
      of hypertension in this population. The ongoing side project on ambulatory blood 
      pressure monitoring in the Syst-Eur study should establish whether these findings 
      hold true for morbidity and mortality.

TI  - The acute effect of phenylpropanolamine and brompheniramine on blood pressure in 
      controlled hypertension: a randomized double-blind crossover trial.
PG  - 503-6
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the acute effect of phenylpropanolamine, 75 mg, and 
      brompheniramine, 12 mg, in combination (PPA/B) on blood pressure in patients with 
      controlled hypertension, using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). DESIGN: 
      Randomized double-blind crossover trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinic at one medical 
      center. PARTICIPANTS: 13 healthy volunteers aged 36 to 64 years, receiving 
      medication for hypertension. INTERVENTIONS: Following 24-hour baseline ABPM, 
      participants were randomized to receive either placebo or PPA/B every 12 hours for 
      three doses, while ABPM continued. After a 24-hour washout period, all participants 
      received the crossover regimen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No clinically 
      important or statistically significant difference was noted for mean systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressures during the baseline (125/75), PPA/B (127/72), and placebo 
      (126/73) phases of the study. Within the first four hours of treatment, the mean 
      change in systolic blood pressure from baseline between PPA/B and placebo phases was 
      1.7 mm Hg (95% CI -5.3 to 8.7), and mean change in diastolic blood pressure was 0.9 
      mm Hg (95% CI -1.6 to 3.5), excluding a first-dose pressor effect. CONCLUSION: When 
      used as recommended, PPA/B, a commonly used over-the-counter cold medication, has no 
      significant acute effect on blood pressure in patients with controlled hypertension.

TI  - Effects of nitrendipine and lisinopril on blood pressure and sodium excretion in 
      ciclosporin-associated hypertension after heart transplantation.
PG  - 141-9
AB  - Hypertension associated with ciclosporin A may be mediated by sodium and volume 
      retention. Therefore, the effects of an antihypertensive therapy (6 weeks) with 
      nitrendipine (10-20 mg twice daily) or lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) on office 
      blood pressure, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, and left ventricular function 
      were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind cross-over trial in patients after 
      heart transplantation. Nitrendipine and lisinopril were equally effective in 
      lowering office and ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures. After an 
      acute sodium load (210 mval/2 h i.v.), sodium excretion was significantly increased 
      during therapy with lisinopril but only slightly during nitrendipine, indicating 
      that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may improve the sodium-retaining state 
      of heart transplant recipients associated with ciclosporin A.

TI  - Automated pulse wave velocity assessment using a professional oscillometric office 
      blood pressure monitor.
PG  - 1817-1823
LID - 10.1111/jch.13966 [doi]
AB  - Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) is the gold standard method for 
      assessing arterial stiffness. This study evaluated automated brachial-ankle PWV 
      (baPWV) taken by a professional oscillometric blood pressure monitor (Microlife 
      WatchBP Office Vascular) versus reference cfPWV (Complior device). Subjects 
      recruited from a hypertension outpatient clinic had duplicate baPWV and cfPWV 
      measurements (randomized crossover design) and carotid ultrasonography. Of 102 
      subjects recruited, 101 had valid baPWV measurements. Four subjects were excluded 
      and 97 were analyzed (age 58.3 ± 11.4 years, men 70%, hypertensives 76%, diabetics 
      17%, cardiovascular disease 10%, smokers 23%). The mean difference between baPWV 
      (13.1 ± 1.8 m/s) and cfPWV (9.1 ± 1.8 m/s) was 4.0 ± 1.4 m/s (P < .01) with close 
      association between them (r = 0.70, P < .01). baPWV and cfPWV were correlated with 
      age (r 0.54/0.49 respectively), systolic blood pressure (0.45/0.50), carotid 
      intima-media thickness (0.31/0.44), and carotid distensibility coefficient 
      (-0.47/-0.34) (all P < .05; no difference between the two methods, z test). There 
      was reasonable agreement (77%) between the two methods in identifying subjects at 
      the top quartile of their distributions (kappa 0.39, P < .01). The areas under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curves for the identification of carotid plaques 
      were comparable for cfPWV and baPWV (0.79 and 0.74 respectively, P = NS). Automated 
      baPWV measurement by a professional oscillometric blood pressure monitor is feasible 
      and observer-independent. baPWV values differ from those by cfPWV, yet they are 
      closely correlated, have reasonable agreement in detecting increased arterial 
      stiffness and give similar associations with carotid stiffness and atherosclerosis.

      revision 2010.
PG  - 255-8
LID - 10.1097/MBP.0000000000000192 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the automated oscillometric 
      wrist blood pressure monitor SCIAN LD-735 for home blood pressure monitoring 
      according to the International Protocol of the European Society of Hypertension 
      revision 2010. METHODS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 
      sequentially in 33 adult Chinese participants (10 women, mean age 44.8 years) using 
      a mercury sphygmomanometer (two observers) and the SCIAN LD-735 device (one 
      supervisor). A total of 99 pairs of comparisons were obtained from 33 participants 
      for judgments in two parts with three grading phases. RESULTS: The SCIAN LD-735 
      device achieved the targets in part 1 of the validation study. The number of 
      absolute differences between device and observers within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg was 
      86/99, 97/99, and 98/99, respectively, for systolic blood pressure and 85/99, 98/99, 
      and 99/99, respectively, for diastolic blood pressure. The device also fulfilled the 
      criteria in part 2 of the validation study. In total, 30 and 33 participants for 
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, had at least two of the three 
      device-observer differences within 5 mmHg (required ≥24). No participant had all of 
      the three device-observer comparisons greater than 5 mmHg for systolic or diastolic 
      blood pressure. CONCLUSION: The SCIAN wrist blood pressure monitor LD-735 has passed 
      the requirements of the International Protocol revision 2010, and hence can be 
      recommended for home use in adults.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure measurement in the elderly.
PG  - S73-7
AB  - A number of problems relating to clinic measurements of blood pressure may be 
      particularly relevant to elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. 
      First, there are large discrepancies in the blood pressure levels measured by these 
      two techniques in the elderly population. Second, while blood pressure is 
      universally accepted as one of the most important risk factors for the development 
      of cardiovascular morbidity, its predictive value in the individual is relatively 
      poor. Clinic and 24-h ambulatory recordings from 318 patients aged 17-80 years, 
      diagnosed as having isolated systolic hypertension on clinic measurement, were 
      compared with reference values determined from 815 healthy bank employees. In the 
      isolated systolic hypertension group, mean systolic blood pressure by daytime 
      ambulatory measurement was 27 mmHg lower than that recorded in the clinic, while 
      diastolic pressure was similar (151 +/- 17/87 +/- 11 versus 178 +/- 28/84 +/- 9 
      mmHg). This discrepancy was greater in women than men, increased slightly but 
      significantly with age (r = 0.12, P less than 0.05) and raised the crucial question 
      as to which of the two measurements might best predict prognosis in this population. 
      In a further study of the association between electrocardiographic (ECG) voltages 
      and blood pressure measured in the clinic and by ambulatory monitoring in 216 
      patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the sum of SV1 + RV5 and the sum of 
      SV1 + RV6 were significantly and positively related to systolic pressure both in the 
      clinic and with daytime and night-time ambulatory measurement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

TI  - Efficacy of a home blood pressure monitoring programme on therapeutic compliance in 
      hypertension: the EAPACUM-HTA study.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a programme of home blood pressure 
      measurement (HBPM) on therapeutic compliance in mild-to-moderate hypertension. 
      DESIGN: A prospective controlled multicentre clinical trial. SETTING: Forty primary 
      care centres in Spain, with a duration of 6 months. PATIENTS: A total of 250 
      patients with newly diagnosed or uncontrolled hypertension were included. 
      INTERVENTIONS: The patients were randomly selected and distributed in two groups: 
      (1) the control group (CG) who received standard health intervention; (2) the 
      intervention group (IG): the patients in this group received an OMRON in their homes 
      for a programme of HBPM. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Four visits were scheduled, for the 
      measurement of blood pressure (BP). They were provided with an electronic monitor 
      for measuring compliance (monitoring events medication system; MEMS). Therapeutic 
      compliance was defined as a drug consumption of 80-110%. A number of variables were 
      calculated using the MEMS. The mean BP were calculated and the percentage of 
      controlled patients. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients completed the study (100 in 
      each group). Compliance was observed in 74 and 92%, respectively, in the CG and IG 
      [95% confidence interval (CI) 63.9-84.1 and 86.7-97.3; P = 0.0001], the mean 
      percentage compliances were 87.6 and 93.5% (95% CI 81.2-94 and 80.7-98.3; P = 
      0.0001), the percentages of correct days were 83.6 and 89.4%, the percentages of 
      subjects who took the medication at the prescribed time were 79.89 and 88.06%, and 
      the levels of therapeutic cover were 86.7 and 93.1%. The number needed to treat to 
      avoid one case of non-compliance was 5.6 patients. The differences in the mean 
      decreases in BP were significant for diastolic BP, with a greater decrease observed 
      in the IG. CONCLUSIONS: An HBPM programme using electronic monitors is effective in 
      improving compliance in arterial hypertension, measured using the MEMS.

TI  - Potassium supplementation reduces clinic and ambulatory blood pressure in elderly 
      hypertensive patients.
PG  - 1403-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of potassium chloride 60 mmol/day 
      supplementation on clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure values in elderly 
      untreated hypertensive patients. DESIGN: A double-blind randomized 
      placebo-controlled crossover study lasting 8 weeks, following a 4-week run-in 
      period. SETTING: Outpatient clinic in a district general hospital. PATIENTS: 
      Eighteen untreated elderly hypertensive patients (mean age 75 years, range 66-79) 
      with a systolic blood pressure of > or = 160 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure 
      of > or = 95 mmHg were recruited from the clinics of local general practitioners and 
      from the current hospital outpatient department. Patients had not received any 
      antihypertensive medication for at least 4 weeks before entry into the study. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Before entry into the study, the daily dietary electrolyte intake of 
      each individual was established and this was maintained during the run-in and 
      intervention periods. Following a 4-week run-in period patients received potassium 
      supplements or matching placebo, each for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 
      within-patient changes in clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressures at the end of 
      each intervention period. RESULTS: After 4 weeks potassium supplementation compared 
      with placebo there was a significant fall in supine clinic blood pressure, standing 
      and 24-h ambulatory systolic blood pressure. There was no significant change in 
      clinic standing diastolic blood pressure, 24-h ambulatory diastolic blood pressure 
      or pulse rate. Plasma renin activity increased and body weight fell after potassium 
      supplementation. Twenty-four-hour urinary potassium rose significantly, whereas 
      urinary sodium excretion was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: A 60-mmol daily supplement of 
      potassium chloride reduces clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in elderly 
      hypertensive patients.

      hypertension].
PG  - 1945-50
AB  - In a prospective open multicentric study two groups (A and B) of patients with 
      essential hypertension used different methods for blood pressure measurements under 
      treatment with the calcium channel blocker nifidipine GITS 30 and 60 mg. Fifty-one 
      patients were followed for 6 weeks. Results of 24 hour blood pressure monitoring at 
      visits after 2, 4 and 6 weeks were only known to physicians of group A. In this 
      group the patients took their blood pressure twice per day. RESULTS: Both methods 
      for measurement showed an overall decrease of blood pressure in the course of 
      therapy. The mean values at the medical visits were always higher than the average 
      measurements by 24 hour monitoring or the self assessment of blood pressure. The 
      latter two blood pressure values tended to agree favorably. The differences between 
      measurements during medical visits and measurements taken at home or during normal 
      activity show that measurements in the doctor's office may lead to overestimation of 
      hypertension. Without the results from blood pressure monitoring 4 (22%) of the 
      patients in group B were treated without reason. Nifedipine GITS was well tolerated. 
      Nine patients (16%) had undesired drug effects leading to a premature halt of 
      treatment in 3 of them.

PG  - 804-10
AB  - Blood pressure was continuously monitored over 24 h in 201 patients with mild to 
      moderate essential hypertension using a noninvasive method. Measurements were made 
      both before and after 6 months of antihypertensive treatment and the data were 
      compared to results from 100 normotensive patients. The frequency with which blood 
      pressure values above 140/90 mm Hg occurred during the 24-h period proved to be the 
      most reliable parameter for distinguishing between hypertensive and normotensive 
      profiles. The blood pressures of all patients could be normalized (less than 140/90 
      mm Hg) on single or combined drug therapy as assessed by casual measurement. 
      However, significant differences were observed between the 24-h profiles of the 
      treated patients and the control group. The mean 24-h blood pressure, the mean day 
      and nighttime blood pressures, the mean hourly pressure, and the frequency of 
      increased blood pressure values were all significantly higher in the patients on 
      medication as compared to the normotensive controls. This would suggest that 
      normotension, as defined by the control group, cannot be attained with 
      antihypertensive medication. In conclusion, 24-h continuous blood pressure 
      monitoring allows a better evaluation of blood pressure profiles and consequently, 
      will be of greater value in assessing cardiovascular risk than occasional random 
      measurements.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effect of 
      sustained-release bupropion on blood pressure in individuals with mild untreated 
      hypertension.
PG  - 302-7
LID - 10.1097/JCP.0b013e318172424e [doi]
AB  - The effects of bupropion on blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated in a 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study of community volunteers with untreated mild 
      (stage 1) hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP], 140-159 mm Hg, and/or 
      diastolic blood pressure, 90-99 mm Hg). Three hundred subjects were randomly 
      assigned (1:1:1:1) to 4 weeks of placebo or bupropion sustained release (SR) 150, 
      300, or 400 mg/d. Mean clinical blood pressures decreased from baseline to the end 
      of protocol in all groups (n = 296): -6.53, -6.46, -4.20, -4.87 mm Hg for SBP; and 
      -2.36, -2.27, -1.95, -1.55 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure, for each group, 
      respectively. Although decreases in mean clinical blood pressure were observed in 
      all groups, the reduction in SBP was less on bupropion SR 300 mg/d than on placebo 
      (-4.20 vs -6.53 mm Hg, respectively; Delta = 2.33, P = 0.020). Neither mean 24-hour 
      ambulatory blood pressure measurements nor the proportion of subjects with 
      clinically significant increases in blood pressure differed between any bupropion SR 
      dose and placebo. Mean heart rate increases were small but statistically significant 
      at 400 mg/d versus placebo (2.28 vs -0.64 beats/min; Delta = 2.92, P = 0.004). 
      Although only minor effects on blood pressure were observed in this trial, an 
      infrequent association of bupropion therapy and treatment-emergent hypertension 
      cannot be ruled out.

      objectives and protocol.
PG  - 25-42
AB  - Study is to test the hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment based on ambulatory 
      monitoring may be more beneficial than treatment guided by conventional 
      sphygmomanometry. After a 2 month run-in period on placebo, eligible hypertensive 
      patients (sitting diastolic pressure > 95 mm Hg on conventional measurement) will be 
      randomized into 2 groups, one in which the target pressure is a sitting diastolic 
      pressure from 80 through 89 mm Hg on conventional sphygmomanometry, and one in which 
      a daytime (from 10 to 20 h) ambulatory diastolic pressure from 80 through 89 mm Hg 
      should be achieved. For 6 months following randomization, treatment consisting of 
      lisinopril 10-20 mg per day, associated with 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 5 mg 
      amlodipine, as necessary, will be stepwise adjusted in order to reach the goal 
      pressure. During this period of the trial the doctor making the therapeutic 
      decisions at the Coordinating Office will be kept blinded with respect to the type 
      of measurement guiding therapy. A final period of 4 months, during which treatment 
      will be adjusted by the patient's personal physician according to the current 
      recommendations, concludes the trial. The outcome measures include the blood 
      pressure level on conventional and ambulatory measurement, the amount of drugs 
      required to achieve the goal blood pressure, side-effects evaluated by a 
      self-administered questionnaire and left ventricular mass as assessed by 
      electrocardiography and echocardiography.

PG  - 648-53
AB  - The objective of this prospective study was to define the limits below which 
      ambulatory blood pressure (BP) does not decrease in patients with essential 
      hypertension, when the decision to institute and intensify drug treatment is based 
      on conventional blood pressure measurements. After a 1 month placebo run-in period, 
      30 patients were treated for 1 year with the converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril 
      or the calcium antagonist isradipine; dose adjustments and the decision to add 
      hydrochlorothiazide were based on conventional blood pressure measurements in the 
      clinic. Ambulatory blood pressure was recorded during 24 h in the run-in period and 
      after 16, 24, and 52 weeks of active therapy. The baseline ambulatory blood pressure 
      below which pressure does, on average, not decrease during active treatment was 
      defined as the pressure at which the regression line between the on-treatment 
      pressure and blood pressure in the run-in period intersects the line of identity. 
      The systolic/diastolic blood pressure limits were similar for the three assessments 
      during active treatment and averaged 128/88 mm Hg for daytime, 106/73 mm Hg for 
      nighttime pressure, and 119/81 mm Hg for the whole 24 h, with upper 95% confidence 
      limits of 137/93, 115/78, and 127/86 mm Hg, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - [Comparative study of bisoprolol and celiprolol in to moderate hypertension using 
      casual as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements].
PG  - 301-6
AB  - A randomised, parallel, double-blind trial was undertaken in 80 patients to compare 
      the efficacy of bisoprolol with that of celiprolol, using causal (BPc) as well as 
      ambulatory (AMBP) blood pressure measurement. After a two week wash-out and two week 
      placebo run-in, patients in whom diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was between 95 and 
      114 mmHg were given either bisoprolol (10 mg/day) or celiprolol (200 mg/day) for 12 
      weeks. When efficacy was insufficient (DBP > 95 mmHg), the dose could be doubled 
      after 4 weeks and a diuretic added after 8 weeks. BPc was measured at each visit and 
      an AMBP obtained the day before the start of active treatment and at its end. Six 
      patients dropped out of the trial because of adverse events. Clinical 
      safety/acceptability of both drugs was good. Demographic data, and blood pressure 
      and heart rate figures in both groups were comparable at the end of the placebo 
      period. Mean fall in BPc in the bisoprolol group was 32.5/20.3 mmHg and 23/17.4 mmHg 
      in the celiprolol group, with a significant difference between the two groups 
      concerning systolic pressure (SBP). Ambulatory measurement showed evidence during 
      the periods 24 hours (H), day and night, of a greater fall with bisoprolol (10.7/8.9 
      mmHg; 13.9/10.8 mmHg; 7.3/7.2 mmHg) than in the celiprolol group (4.9/21.6; 7.3/3.8; 
      2.9/2 mmHg), the difference being significant for diastolic blood pressure (DBP: p < 
      0.01; p < 0.05; p < 0.05. Thus bisoprolol was more effective than celiprolol in mild 
      to moderate hypertension, but the difference was significant for SBP by casual 
      measurement and for DBP by ambulatory measurement.

TI  - Validation of the Tel-O-GRAPH, a new oscillometric blood pressure-measuring device, 
      according to the British Hypertension Society protocol.
PG  - 307-9

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor. Therefore, the 
      accuracy of blood pressure (BP) measurement with self-measuring devices is of 
      fundamental importance. Consequently, emerging BP devices should be evaluated 
      against the gold standard according to an established and proven protocol. METHODS: 
      Tel-O-GRAPH, a new oscillometric self-measuring device of brachial BP, was evaluated 
      against auscultatory sphygmomanometry according to the BHS protocol. Bland-Altman 
      plots were completed for systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and the 
      mean differences and SDs between the test device and the reference device were 
      computed for all BP values. RESULTS: A total of 85 individuals (mean age 48.11±18.0 
      years; 61% men) were included after they provided informed consent. Overall, 510 
      measurements were performed. The mean device-observer difference was -0.2±6.6 for 
      SBP and 0.2±6.6 for DBP. The device achieved grade A for SBP and DBP for both 
      observers. Examination of the different BP ranges indicated grade B for SBP more 
      than 160 mmHg and grade A for all BP ranges. CONCLUSION: Tel-O-GRAPH fulfilled the 
      accuracy requirements of the BHS with the highest accuracy level (A) and can thus be 
      used reliably in the oscillometric measurement of the brachial BP.

TI  - A cross-over evaluation of different methods and devices to measure blood pressure 
      in type 1 diabetic patients with nephropathy.
PG  - 175-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: In type 1 diabetic patients with nephropathy, tight blood pressure 
      control has been shown to prevent the progression of the disease. Up until now, 
      self-monitoring, ambulatory and office blood pressure values have not been compared 
      in these patients. Thus, we have evaluated blood pressure values obtained in the 
      office by a physician and at home by self-monitoring with those measured under 
      ambulatory conditions in these patients. Additionally, for blood pressure 
      self-monitoring, three different devices (the sphygmomanometer, upper-arm 
      oscillometer and wrist oscillometer) were compared. METHODS: Twenty-one treated 
      hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients [age 45+/-9 years, duration of diabetes 
      33+/-12 years (mean+/-SD)] with overt diabetic nephropathy participated in this 
      study. At both baseline and the end of the study, daytime ambulatory blood pressure 
      measurement was performed. Office blood pressure was measured at baseline. 
      Additionally, all the patients measured their blood pressure over a 3-week period 
      using each of the three different devices, in random order, for 1 week. RESULTS: The 
      mean office blood pressure values (135+/-21/85+/-12mmHg) were higher than both the 
      ambulatory (131+/-23/80+/-12, P<0.05) and self-monitoring values (130+/-14/78+/-10; 
      P<0.05 for systolic and P<0.02 for diastolic values). The difference between the 
      ambulatory and self-monitoring values were not statistically significant. Diastolic 
      blood pressure values measured with the oscillometric wrist device showed a trend 
      towards higher values when compared to those measured with the sphygmomanometer and 
      with the oscillometric upper-arm device (P=0.065 for diastolic values). CONCLUSION: 
      Office blood pressure measurements may over-estimate blood pressure in patients with 
      type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Because the oscillometric wrist device 
      tends to over-estimate diastolic values, upper-arm devices should be preferred for 
      blood pressure self-monitoring in these patients.

TI  - Self-monitoring of blood pressure for improving adherence to antihypertensive 
      medicines and blood pressure control: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1339-45
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpu062 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring is reported to have limited efficacy for hypertension 
      management in high-income countries. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect 
      of self-monitoring on blood pressure (BP) control in an Iranian population. METHODS: 
      A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 196 mild to moderate hypertensive 
      patients in an outpatient cardiovascular clinic. Patients in the intervention group 
      received a wrist self-monitoring device and were educated to measure and document 
      their BP daily during the study period (24 weeks). Patients in the control group 
      received usual care. Three follow-up visits with the physician were scheduled for 
      all patients (weeks 4, 12, and 24), and the investigator assessed adherence to 
      medications after each visit (pill counting). The primary outcome (BP) was compared 
      between groups using repeated-measure analysis of variance. RESULTS: One hundred 
      ninety patients completed the study. Systolic BP (144.4±7.4 vs 145.9±6.4mm Hg) and 
      diastolic BP (85.5±6.9 vs. 85.1±7.7mm Hg) were similar between groups at baseline. 
      The trend of BP was not significantly different between groups during the study 
      period. Systolic and diastolic BP decreased significantly in both groups at the 
      first follow-up visit (systolic BP: 132.6 vs. 133.4mm Hg; diastolic BP: 77.4 vs. 
      77.2mm Hg). In the intervention group, we observed a small continued decrease in 
      diastolic BP up to week 24 BP (P = 0.01). Both groups showed adherence rates >95% 
      during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Our study could not confirm that 
      self-monitoring can improve BP control in patients with frequent medical visits.

TI  - Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure profile of a new slow-release formulation 
      of diltiazem in mild to moderate hypertension.
PG  - 701-7
AB  - Twelve patients with a mild to moderate essential hypertension were included in a 
      double-blind, balanced, randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study to assess the 
      efficacy and duration of action of a new slow-release formulation of diltiazem (300 
      mg) given once daily for 3 weeks. All office blood pressure measurements were done 
      24 hours after drug intake. In order to improve the accuracy of the trial, 24-hours 
      non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Spacelabs 90207 system) were 
      performed as well. Diltiazem significantly lowered supine and standing systolic and 
      diastolic office blood pressure (by 16.9/12.7 mmHg and by 17.3/13.8 mmHg, 
      respectively), without changing office heart rate. Diltiazem also significantly 
      lowered ambulatory blood pressure measured over 24 hours, as well as ambulatory 
      heart rate. The blood pressure lowering effect was most pronounced during the 
      daytime period and did not reach statistical significance during the sleeping hours. 
      The treatment was well tolerated, and there were no significant side effects. The 
      results confirm the antihypertensive efficacy of diltiazem LP 300 mg once daily 
      during the daytime and during the early morning blood pressure rise, without 
      inducing nocturnal hypotension.

TI  - Comparative effects of valsartan plus either cilnidipine or hydrochlorothiazide on 
      home morning blood pressure surge evaluated by information and communication 
      technology-based nocturnal home blood pressure monitoring.
PG  - 159-167
LID - 10.1111/jch.13154 [doi]
AB  - The authors tested the hypothesis that a valsartan/cilnidipine combination would 
      suppress the home morning blood pressure (BP) surge (HMBPS) more effectively than a 
      valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination in patients with morning hypertension, 
      defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥135 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥85 mm Hg assessed by a 
      self-measuring information and communication technology-based home BP monitoring 
      device more than three times before either combination's administration. This was an 
      8-week prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial. The HMBPS, 
      which is a new index, was defined as the mean morning SBP minus the mean nocturnal 
      SBP, both measured on the same day. The authors randomly allocated 129 patients to 
      the valsartan/cilnidipine (63 patients; mean 68.4 years) or 
      valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (66 patients; mean 67.3 years) combination groups, and 
      the baseline HMBPS values were 17.4 mm Hg vs 16.9 mm Hg, respectively (P = .820). At 
      the end of the treatment period, the changes in nocturnal SBP and morning SBP from 
      baseline were significant in both the valsartan/cilnidipine and 
      valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide groups (P < .001): -5.0 vs -10.0 mm Hg (P = .035) and 
      -10.7 vs -13.6 mm Hg (P = .142), respectively. HMBPS was significantly decreased 
      from baseline in both groups (P < .001), but there was no significant difference 
      between the two groups: 14.4 mm Hg vs 14.0 mm Hg, respectively (P = .892). 
      Valsartan/cilnidipine could not significantly suppress HMBPS compared with 
      valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide. Large-scale randomized controlled studies are needed 
      to assess how reducing HMBPS will affect future cardiovascular outcomes. The 
      information and communication technology-based home BP monitoring device may become 
      an alternative to ambulatory BP monitoring, which has been a gold standard to 
      measure nocturnal BP and the morning BP surge.

AB  - This study evaluated the accuracy and reliability of the Dinamap 8100 automated 
      blood pressure machine against three internationally recognized criteria. Systolic 
      and diastolic blood pressures were taken concurrently by two nurses using the 
      automated machine and a manual sphygmomanometer. Results demonstrated agreement 
      between automated and manual readings on one set of criteria for both systolic and 
      diastolic pressures, and support for systolic readings only on one other criterion. 
      Comparison of mean differences between automated and manual measures showed the 
      automated machine consistently under-read both systolic and diastolic blood 
      pressures. The conclusion from this study was that the Dinamap 8100 machine can be 
      used with some degree of confidence to assess systolic blood pressures in a general 
      population of adult hospital inpatients, but with caution when taking diastolic 
      readings.

TI  - Validation of the A&D wrist-cuff UB-511 (UB-512) device for self-measurement of 
      blood pressure.
PG  - 349-54
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of the A&D UB-511 (UB-512) oscillometric 
      wrist-cuff device for self-measurement of blood pressure, the only difference 
      between the two devices being the size of storage memory. METHODS: Device evaluation 
      was performed according to the modified British Hypertension Society protocol 
      released in 1993. Eighty-five study participants with characteristics outlined in 
      the British Hypertension Society protocol were recruited among those attending our 
      out-patient clinic. The device was evaluated according to the various steps of the 
      protocol. The non-dominant arm was used for blood pressure measurement. To maintain 
      the wrist at cardiac level during validation, the arm was kept horizontal at the 
      mid-sternum level and supported by a soft table. The wrist was kept extended. 
      Sequential readings were taken for the main validation test. Outcome was classified 
      according to the criteria of the British Hypertension Society recommendations, which 
      are based on four strata of accuracy differing from the mercury standard by 5, 10 
      and 15 mmHg, or more. RESULTS: The device achieved a British Hypertension Society 
      grade B for systolic and a grade B for diastolic blood pressure. The device tended 
      to overestimate arm blood pressure, the mean difference (+/-1 SD) between device and 
      observers being 4.3+/-8.7 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 3.7+/-8.1 mmHg for 
      diastolic blood pressure for observer 2, and 4.4+/-8.6 mmHg for systolic blood 
      pressure and 3.8+/-7.9 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure for observer 1. In a 
      logistic regression analysis, age was the sole predictor of an achieved difference 
      between device and mercury column by 5 mmHg or less (hazard ratio 1.020; 95% 
      confidence interval 1.003-1.04; P=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the A&D 
      UB-511 (UB-512) device satisfies the British Hypertension Society recommendations 
      with a grade B/B. The device tends to overestimate cuff blood pressure and its 
      accuracy increases with age.

TI  - Management of hypertension in the elderly using home blood pressures.
PG  - 139-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether patient-measured home blood pressures alone can be 
      used to manage hypertension in adults 65 years and older. METHODS: 40 hypertensive 
      men and women, average age 73 +/- 6 years, were randomly assigned to one of two 
      treatment decision groups. The 'home' group (N = 20) had blood pressure managed and 
      medication changed according to measurements taken by the patient at home with the 
      Omron HEM-702 semi-automatic oscillometric digital blood pressure monitor and the 
      'clinic' group (N = 20) had medication adjusted based upon readings taken by the 
      project nurse in the clinic. In both groups, treated hypertensives had medications 
      adjusted downward, while untreated hypertensives were started on a diuretic and/or 
      ACE inhibitor and adjustments were made upward. To assess the efficacy of the home 
      measurements as a means of hypertension management, 24-hour ambulatory blood 
      pressure averages, quality of life (From the QOL SF-36), and dosage of 
      antihypertensive medications were compared between the home and clinic groups over a 
      three-month period. RESULTS: At baseline, the 'home' group had slightly higher 
      ambulatory awake and sleep blood pressure than the 'clinic' group. At 3 months, the 
      average awake and sleep ambulatory blood pressure for the 'home' group decreased to 
      the level of the 'clinic' group. Values of the 'clinic' group did not change. In 
      both groups, pressures of previously treated patients increased over the 3 months, 
      while those that were previously untreated declined. However, this difference, to 
      some extent, might be expected because the acceptable limit of pressure control (150 
      / 90 mmHg) was higher than many of the patients on medications; thus, their 
      pressures could increase and still be considered controlled. Those patients who were 
      previously untreated had their pressures decreased only to this level. The 
      nurse-measured clinic blood pressures for the 'home' group began higher than that of 
      the 'clinic' group and remained higher at the end of the study. Average home 
      pressures of the 'home' group were consistently lower than nurse-measured clinic 
      pressures over the 3-month study period, indicating a persistent 'white coat' 
      effect. Both groups had similar changes in total quality of life scores. 
      Decrease/discontinuance of antihypertensive medication was also achieved equally in 
      both groups at the end of 3 months. CONCLUSION: Home blood pressure monitoring alone 
      may be as useful as clinic measurements for making treatment decisions in the 
      elderly.

AB  - To ensure a high degree of patient compliance, and thus, therapeutic safety also, an 
      antihypertensive agent should lower blood pressure for 24 h when taken once a day. A 
      placebo-controlled investigation was carried out in 22 patients with essential 
      arterial hypertension, to ascertain whether this was the case with once daily 
      administration of ramipril. Blood pressure was measured at rest, during exercise, 
      and under outpatient conditions (ambulant blood pressure measurement-ABPM). In our 
      study, ramipril had an excellent 24-h effect and was found to be suitable for 
      administration once a day. ABPM represents the most comprehensive and reliable means 
      of monitoring antihypertensive treatment, particularly since it also provides data 
      about nocturnal blood pressure behavior and additionally enables the most 
      distinctive determination of the trough to peak-ratio.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of potassium and calcium supplementation in 
      table salt on reduction of arterial blood pressure and sodium metabolism in 
      adolescents with higher blood pressure. METHODS: A single blind placebo-controlled 
      trial was carried out for two years in 220 adolescents with higher blood pressure, 
      aged 18 - 22 years, who were randomly divided into supplementary group (n = 110) and 
      control group (n = 110). Each of the subjects in the supplementary group and their 
      family members was given 10 mmol of potassium and 10 mmol of calcium mixed in their 
      table salt daily for 24 months. RESULTS: Night urinary sodium and potassium 
      excretion increased (urinary Na(+), P < 0.05; urinary K(+), P < 0.01) and blood 
      pressure lowered by 5.3 mm Hg/1.8 mm Hg in average from the baseline in the 
      supplementary group two years after potassium and calcium supplementation, as 
      compared with that in the control group increased by (1.3/1.7) mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Adequate supplement of potassium and calcium in daily table salt intake was an 
      effective way to prevent form hypertension and could promote their urinary sodium 
      excretion and reduction of arterial blood pressure in adolescents with higher blood 
      pressure.

TI  - Continuous positive airway pressure does not reduce blood pressure in nonsleepy 
      hypertensive OSA patients.
PG  - 1229-35
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality. Several randomised controlled trials have shown that continuous positive 
      airway pressure (CPAP) treatment of OSA reduces blood pressure (BP). This 
      randomised, sham-placebo controlled crossover trial assesses whether CPAP produces a 
      similar clinically significant fall in BP in hypertensive OSA patients, but without 
      hypersomnolence. Thirty-five, nonsleepy, hypertensive patients with OSA were treated 
      with CPAP for 1 month, randomised first to either therapeutic or sham-placebo 
      (subtherapeutic CPAP, about 1 cmH(2)O pressure). The second months' alternative 
      treatment followed a 2-week washout period. BP was measured over 24 h, before and at 
      the end of the two treatment periods: mean 24-h BP was the primary outcome variable. 
      There was no overall significant difference in mean 24-h BP: the change in mean 24-h 
      BP on therapeutic CPAP was -2.1 mmHg (sd 8.1), and -1.1 mmHg (sd 8.1) on 
      subtherapeutic CPAP, with a difference of 0.7 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      +2.9- -4.4). There was a small significant fall in Epworth Sleepiness Score, 
      therapeutic (-1.4) versus sham (-0.3), and difference -1.2 (95% CI -2.0- -0.4), but 
      no change in objective sleepiness. In nonhypersomnolent hypertensive patients with 
      obstructive sleep apnoea, there is no significant fall in mean 24-h blood pressure 
      with continuous positive airway pressure, in contrast to the fall seen in 
      hypersomnolent patients with obstructive sleep apnoea.

TI  - The effect of verbal instructions on blood pressure measurement.
PG  - 293-6
AB  - AIM: To determine whether orally delivered instructions can modify the intensity and 
      direction of blood pressure and heart rate fluctuation. METHODS: The blood pressure 
      of 120 subjects, 60 hypertensive and 60 normotensive, was measured before and after 
      oral instructions. The normotensive subjects were selected from a sample of 
      university students and the hypertensive patients were selected at a routine medical 
      screening. Each sample of 60 subjects was randomly divided into four groups of 15. 
      Each subject was left seated alone in a room for 5 min. The researcher then measured 
      the subjects' blood pressure and heart rate. Following this, each group of 
      normotensives and hypertensives was told that their blood pressure would diminish, 
      or that it would not change or that it would increase. The control group was given 
      no instructions. After 5 min the blood pressure and heart were measured again. 
      RESULTS: In the normotensive and hypertensive groups who were told that their blood 
      pressure would increase, systolic blood pressure increased by 4.3 and 2.5 mmHg, 
      respectively. In the groups who were told that their blood pressure would decrease, 
      systolic pressure fell by 7.8 and 7.4 mmHg, respectively. Those who were told that 
      no change would occur showed a systolic pressure decrease of 3.5 and 1.8 mmHg, 
      respectively. In the control groups systolic blood pressure decreased by 5.6 and 4.2 
      mmHg, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that oral instructions are a 
      source of variation in the assessment of blood pressure and emphasize the need for 
      24-h blood pressure monitoring to eliminate this type of variation.

TI  - Home blood pressure monitoring. Effect on use of medical services and medical care 
      costs.
PG  - 855-65
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether a hypertension management 
      program in which patients monitor their own blood pressure (BP) at home can reduce 
      costs without compromising BP control. The prospective, randomized, controlled 
      1-year clinical trial was conducted at four medical centers of the Kaiser Permanente 
      Medical Care Program in the San Francisco Bay Area. Of 467 patients with 
      uncomplicated hypertension who were referred by their physicians, 37 declined to 
      participate in the study; 215 were randomly assigned to a Usual Care (UC) group and 
      215 to a Home BP group. Twenty-five UC patients and 15 Home BP patients did not 
      return for year-end BP measurements. Patients in the UC group were referred back to 
      their physicians. Patients in the Home BP group were trained to measure their own BP 
      and return the readings by mail. Patients were given a standard procedure to follow 
      in case of unusually high or low BP readings at home. The number and type of 
      outpatient medical services used were obtained from patient medical records for the 
      study year and the prior year. Costs of care for hypertension were calculated by 
      assigning relative value units to each outpatient service. Trained technicians 
      measured each patient's BP at entry into the study and 1 year later. Home BP 
      patients made 1.2 fewer hypertension-related office visits than UC patients during 
      the study year (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8, 1.7). Mean adjusted cost for 
      physician visits, telephone calls, and laboratory tests associated with hypertension 
      care was $88.76 per patient per year in the Home BP group, 29% less than in the UC 
      group (95% CI: $16.11, $54.74). The annualized cost of implementing the home BP 
      system was approximately $28 per patient during the study year and would currently 
      be approximately $15. After 1 year, BP control in men in the Home BP group was 
      better than in men in the UC group; BP control was equally good in women in both 
      groups. Management of uncomplicated hypertension based on periodic home BP reports 
      can achieve BP control with fewer physician visits, resulting in substantial cost 
      savings.

AB  - High blood pressure (BP) is a highly controllable risk factor for cardiovascular 
      diseases; however, awareness of this condition and the rates of controlled 
      hypertension are low. Experimental animal studies have shown that stimulation of the 
      median nerve or PC6 acupoint over the wrist has effects on cardiovascular 
      activities, including reductions in systolic and diastolic BPs. A proof-of-concept 
      study was conducted in humans to investigate whether stimulation of median 
      nerve near PC6 acupoint decreased high BP, identify the optimal stimulation 
      parameters for the BP-lowering effects of median nerve stimulation, and determine 
      the specific peripheral nerves or types of afferent fibers mediating the BP-lowering 
      effects. Median nerve stimulation was carried out bilaterally or unilaterally with 
      different stimulation parameters, and the BP and heart rate were monitored. The 
      afferent mechanisms underlying the effects of median nerve stimulation on 
      hypertension were investigated via microneurography, A-fiber blocking experiments, 
      and localized chemical or electrical stimulation. Bilateral median nerve stimulation 
      at either low or high frequencies produced profound but transient reductions in 
      systolic BP, which were elicited when median nerve stimulation was unilaterally 
      applied at interelectrode distances of 2 and 4 cm. Systolic BP was also reduced by 
      electrical stimulation of the thumb on the palm side. Although microneurographic 
      recordings revealed the excitation of both A- and C-fibers following median nerve 
      stimulation, the median nerve-mediated reductions in BP were not affected by A-fiber 
      blockade, and they were mimicked by the activation of C-fibers with capsaicin. The 
      present results indicate that activation of C-fibers in the median nerve generates 
      BP-lowering effects in humans. Based on our clinical study, an optimized median 
      nerve stimulator was built and combined with a wrist BP monitor for simultaneous BP 
      measurements and median nerve stimulation.

TI  - The effect of amlodipine on ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive patients.
PG  - 39A-43A
AB  - Certain high-risk populations, such as diabetics and blacks, have sustained 
      elevation in blood pressure and heart rate throughout the day and night, with 
      blunting of the usual diurnal variability pattern. This may contribute to their 
      higher incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (blacks) and cardiovascular 
      complications (diabetics). Hypertensives who maintain a diurnal pattern of blood 
      pressure variation still exhibit higher daytime and nocturnal blood pressure levels 
      than normotensives. Thus, to achieve maximum effectiveness in treating hypertension, 
      24-hour control of blood pressure is necessary. Antihypertensive agents should 
      effectively reduce blood pressure consistently throughout a 24-hour period. The 
      objective of this study was to assess the effects of amlodipine, 5 mg once daily, on 
      blood pressure measured by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring in a randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled single-site study. Patients with mild-to-moderate 
      essential hypertension were randomized to receive amlodipine (n = 11) or placebo (n 
      = 5) in a 2:1 ratio. A 4-week single-blind placebo run-in period was followed by a 
      4-week double-blind phase. Ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure was carried out 
      for 24 hours at the end of each 4-week phase. Patients receiving amlodipine had 
      significantly lower blood pressure compared with placebo 24 hours after the last 
      dose (supine blood pressure -25.1/-10.1 mm Hg; standing blood pressure -21.2/-9.7 mm 
      Hg) after 4 weeks of treatment. This effect was clearly demonstrated by the 24-hour 
      postdose measurement and the mean blood pressure over the 24-hour interval as 
      measured by ambulatory recordings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      pressure monitoring.
PG  - 418-26
AB  - The authors compared the relative safety and efficacy of changing treatment from 
      once-daily atenolol to metoprolol in patients with essential hypertension. A 
      parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted in two phases: a 4-week 
      baseline single-blind phase using atenolol 50 mg, followed by a 4-week randomized 
      double-blind treatment phase using either atenolol 50 mg or metoprolol 100 mg 
      administered once daily at noontime. Patients with well-controlled hypertension 
      already prescribed 50 mg of atenolol (with or without the addition of a diuretic) 
      for control of hypertension were selected for participation from the outpatient 
      hypertension clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 
      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Seated blood pressure (BP) and pulse were obtained during 
      the baseline phase and during the randomized treatment phase. Twenty-four-hour 
      ambulatory BP monitoring was performed once during the baseline phase and once 
      during the randomized treatment phase, near the end of each 4-week period. There 
      were no within- and between-treatment differences in office systolic and diastolic 
      BP. There was a slight increase in pulse (average = 5.2 beats/minute; P = .02) for 
      those participants treated with metoprolol. For within-treatment groups, the 
      ambulatory BP data showed no significant differences in systolic and diastolic BPs, 
      except for an increase in morning diastolic BP for those randomized to metoprolol 
      (average = 6.2 mm Hg; P = .01). For between-treatment groups, the metoprolol arm had 
      a higher morning systolic BP (P = .01), a higher morning diastolic BP (P = .03), and 
      a higher nighttime heart rate (P = .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      Multicenter Study Group.
PG  - 737-42
AB  - Ramipril is a new, potent nonsulfhydryl inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme. 
      The magnitude and duration of its antihypertensive effect were evaluated in a 
      multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted in 100 patients 
      with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Ramipril significantly reduced both 
      supine and standing blood pressures measured 24 h after dosing. Automated blood 
      pressure monitoring showed that ramipril significantly reduced systolic and 
      diastolic pressures for 24 h after dosing. The peak effect occurred between 3 and 6 
      h after dosing, with approximately 50% of this effect retained after 24 h. Ramipril 
      was well tolerated; there was no significant difference between active drug and 
      placebo in the overall incidence of side effects. Ramipril is an effective and 
      well-tolerated antihypertensive agent, which reduces both supine and standing blood 
      pressure over the entire 24-h period after dosing.

TI  - Use of home blood pressure monitoring among hypertensive adults in primary care: 
      Minhang community survey.
PG  - 140-4
LID - 10.1097/MBP.0000000000000035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several evidences have supported the benefits of home blood pressure 
      monitoring (HBPM) in improving hypertension awareness and control. However, little 
      was known about the use of HBPM by hypertensive patients in primary care in China. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey on HBPM use was 
      conducted on 1915 hypertensive patients in Xinzhuang County Hospital in Shanghai, 
      and the factors related to regular use of HBPM were also determined. RESULTS: 
      Overall, 1011 of the 1915 participants engaged in using HBPM, among whom 786 
      individuals used HBPM more than once a month. Of the 1011 HBPM users, 25.42% chose a 
      mercury sphygmomanometer, 33.55% used wrist-cuff electronic devices, and 46.5% 
      selected arm-cuff electronic devices. In addition, 73% of HBPM users reported HBP 
      readings to their general practitioners. Compared with the less frequent users, 
      patients who used HBPM daily were likely to report their blood pressure (BP) values 
      to the doctors depending on notebook or mechanical memory than on their own memories 
      (P<0.001). Moreover, patients with college education were 2.7 times more likely than 
      those with middle school education or less to engage in frequent HBPM use (odds 
      ratio=2.71, 95% confidence interval=2.03-3.61). CONCLUSION: This local community 
      survey showed that ∼40% of hypertension patients used HBPM frequently in primary 
      care in China. However, certain patients chose the improper BP monitoring device or 
      questionable reporting methods. Therefore, the use of arm-cuff electric devices with 
      multiple memory storage or a home BP telemonitoring system should be promoted by 
      health education targeted at hypertensive patients.

PG  - 2689-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Home blood pressure (BP) monitoring improves BP control, but it is 
      unknown whether patients accurately report home BP readings to their physician. This 
      study compared self-reported with electronically stored home BP and heart rate (HR) 
      readings and evaluated this agreement in patients with controlled vs. uncontrolled 
      hypertension. METHODS: A single-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted in an 
      ambulatory managed care population. Subjects were identified by hypertension-related 
      codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (401.0, 
      401.1, and 401.9). Subjects recorded systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and HR 3 
      times daily for 1 week by means of a digital BP monitor. Subjects were unaware that 
      the monitor electronically stored results. RESULTS: Thirty subjects were enrolled 
      (29 complete data sets); their mean age (+/-SD) was 56+/-9 years, and 15 (52%) were 
      women. Sixty-eight percent of subject-recorded SBP, DBP, and HR measurements were 
      identical to electronically stored results. Twenty percent of recorded SBPs and 17% 
      of recorded DBPs differed from stored SBP and DBP by more than 10 mm Hg. Erroneous 
      reporting was evident in 9% of uncontrolled vs 4% of controlled SBPs (P<.001). 
      Similarly, 21% of uncontrolled and 4% of controlled DBPs were erroneously reported 
      (P<.001). In cases where the stored HR exceeded 100 beats/min, 43% of HR readings 
      were recorded as 100 beats/min or less (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most self-reported BP 
      and HR readings were identical to electronically stored measurements. However, 
      erroneous reporting occurred significantly more often in cases of uncontrolled BP 
      and HR, which may misguide physicians in the optimal treatment of their patients 
      with hypertension.

PG  - 41-4
AB  - First-dose-response of captopril 1 x 25 mg (no prodrug) and ramipril 1 x 2.5 mg 
      (prodrug) were compared in two groups of 17 patients with moderate or severe 
      hypertension and stimulated renin-angiotensin system (because of continuous diuretic 
      therapy) by means of 24-h blood-pressure measurement at the 1st and 7th day of 
      therapy. In the ramipril-group the antihypertensive effect started after 2 h, had 
      its maximum (mean: -13/-8 mmHg) after 4 h and remained unchanged for 8 h. The 
      antihypertensive effect was significant for 24 h. There was a slightly but not 
      significant improved blood-pressure reduction at the 7th day compared to the 1st. 
      The captopril-group showed a fast and marked decrease of blood pressure within the 
      first hour, and reached its maximum (mean: -18/-10 mmHg) after 2 h. After 7 h there 
      was no antihypertensive effect detectable. At the 7th day blood-pressure reduction 
      was less pronounced compared to the 1st day. The results show that initial decrease 
      of blood pressure in risk-patients is less severe with prodrug-ACE-inhibitors with 
      slow onset of action so that counterregulation can be activated and prevent severe, 
      fast, ACE-inhibitor-induced hypotension. 24-h-blood-pressure measurement is a 
      sufficient method to evaluate first-dose-response of ACE-inhibitors.

TI  - Differences in the acute and chronic antihypertensive effects of lisinopril and 
      enalapril assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
PG  - 71-89
AB  - Although lisinopril and enalapril are equipotent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
      inhibitors lisinopril has been reported to produce greater inhibition of plasma ACE 
      24 hours after single doses. This study compared the antihypertensive effects of 
      once daily 10mg doses of the drugs using a randomised, double-blind, two period 
      cross-over design with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Lisinopril lowered mean 
      24 hour systolic blood pressure significantly more than enalapril after 4 weeks of 
      treatment (14/7 +/- 2/1mmHg & 9/6 +/- 2/1mmHg, respectively, adjusted SBP difference 
      4.8mmHg, P < 0.01). This difference was confined to the second 12 hours of the daily 
      dosage interval (adjusted SBP difference 13-24 hours after dosing 9.9mmHg, P < 
      0.001). The diastolic pressure showed a similar trend but this was not statistically 
      significant. The side effects of each agent were minor. We conclude that chronic, 
      once daily therapy with 10mg of lisinopril reduces systolic blood pressure more 
      effectively than an equal dose of enalapril due to its greater effect in the latter 
      half of the 24 hour dosage interval.

AB  - This paper reports subgroup analysis of a successful cluster-randomized trial to 
      identify attributes of hypertensive patients who benefited more or less from an 
      intervention combining blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring and pharmacist management. 
      The end point was BP < 140/90 mm Hg at 6-month follow-up. Fourteen baseline patient 
      characteristics were selected a priori as subgroup variables. Among the 351 trial 
      participants, 44% were female, 84% non-Hispanic white, mean age was 60.9 years, and 
      mean BP was 149/86 mm Hg. The overall adjusted odds ratio for BP control in the 
      intervention versus usual care group was 3.64 (P < .001). The effect of the 
      intervention was significantly larger in patients who were younger (interaction 
      P = .02), did not have diabetes (P = .005), had high baseline diastolic BP 
      (P = .02), added salt less than daily in food preparation (P = .007), and took 0-2 
      (rather than 3-6) antihypertensive medication classes at baseline (P = .02). These 
      findings may help prioritize patients for whom the intervention is most effective.

TI  - Assessing the clinical need for short-term conversion from oral to parenteral 
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in hypertensive patients. A 
      quinapril to quinaprilat placebo-controlled model.
PG  - 140-7
AB  - RATIONALE AND STUDY DESIGN: This study assesses safety and efficacy when 
      hypertensive patients convert from an oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, 
      quinapril, to its intravenous counterpart, quinaprilat, and evaluates the need for 
      short-term conversion from oral to parenteral therapy. Blood pressure was measured 
      by clinical measurements using a sphygmomanometer and by 24-h ambulatory blood 
      pressure monitoring. During a placebo-baseline phase, patients blood pressure had to 
      increase within 3 days in the absence of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. 
      Responding patients were stabilized on oral quinapril and then randomized to 3 days 
      of double-blind treatment with one 5 ml or 10 ml injection twice daily of 
      quinaprilat or placebo. RESULTS: Overall response to quinaprilat in ambulatory blood 
      pressure monitoring and clinic blood pressure measurements was not statistically or 
      clinically different from the response to oral quinapril therapy during baseline. 
      Withdrawal from quinapril resulted in clinically significant increases in all blood 
      pressure measurements compared with baseline therapy; the differences between 
      placebo and quinaprilat therapy were statistically and clinically significant. Two 
      patients treated with quinaprilat withdrew due to hypotension; one patient required 
      a dosage reduction. Parenteral quinaprilat safely maintained blood pressure control 
      whereas placebo control did not during the 72-h interruption of quinapril.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated whether antihypertensive therapy using a home blood 
      pressure monitor (HBPM) equipped with a graphic display of weekly and monthly 
      averaged blood pressure (BP) can obtain better BP control than the conventional 
      HBPM. Sixty-five hypertensive outpatients who had HBP >135/85 mm Hg were enrolled by 
      8 doctors in 2 different hospitals. The patients were randomly assigned either a 
      graph-equipped HBPM (graph-equipped HBPM group; n=33) or an HBPM without the graph 
      function (conventional HBPM group; n=32). The patients were treated with 
      antihypertensive medications targeting HBP <135/85 mm Hg. After 2 months, the home 
      systolic BP level was lower in the graph-equipped HBPM group than in the 
      conventional HBPM group (141.3+/-15.4 vs 147.7+/-10.8 mm Hg; P<.05); its reduction 
      was significantly larger in the former group (11.9 vs 5.6 mm Hg; P<.05). Using an 
      HBP device with a graphic display could accelerate the achievement of BP control.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A tool for more comprehensive assessment.
PG  - 1-27
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the usefulness of more comprehensive blood pressure 
      measurements, made during daily life, in the diagnosis and treatment of 
      hypertension. METHODS: A blood pressure screening was carried out in middle-aged men 
      and women in Kävlinge, a municipality in southern Sweden. Subjects were classified 
      according to Swedish standard criteria. Ambulatory blood pressure (amb-BP) was 
      recorded in a random sample of normotensives and borderline hypertensives as well as 
      in all the untreated hypertensives identified at screening and willing to 
      participate. A subgroup of borderline hypertensives also carried out 
      self-measurements of blood pressure (self-BP) both at work and at home. The blood 
      pressure lowering efficacy of atenolol 50 mg o.d. and enalapril 20 mg o.d. was 
      compared in hypertensives at rest, during 24 hours, and during dynamic and isometric 
      exercise. The efficacy of enalapril and lisinopril (two ACE inhibitors with 
      different durations of action) were also compared, with special focus on the early 
      morning hours. RESULTS: Men and women classified as normotensives clearly differed 
      from those with hypertension, also when blood pressure was recorded with ambulatory 
      technique. The number of correctly classified subjects did not differ between 
      self-BP and office-BP; combining the two added little. Atenolol reduced blood 
      pressure better during dynamic exercise than did enalapril, while there was no 
      significant difference in effect between enalapril and lisinopril, not even 18-24 
      hours post-dose. CONCLUSION: More comprehensive blood pressure measurements should 
      be considered in the evaluation of hypertension treatment. Office BP, however, seems 
      a reasonably good tool for diagnosing hypertension.

TI  - Can validated wrist devices with position sensors replace arm devices for self-home 
      blood pressure monitoring? A randomized crossover trial using ambulatory monitoring 
      as reference.
PG  - 753-8
LID - 10.1038/ajh.2008.176 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic devices that measure blood pressure (BP) at the arm level are 
      regarded as more accurate than wrist devices and are preferred for home BP (HBP) 
      monitoring. Recently, wrist devices with position sensors have been successfully 
      validated using established protocols. This study assessed whether HBP values 
      measured with validated wrist devices are sufficiently reliable to be used for 
      making patient-related decisions in clinical practice. METHODS: This randomized 
      crossover study compared HBP measurements taken using validated wrist devices 
      (wrist-HBP, Omron R7 with position sensor) with those taken using arm devices 
      (arm-HBP, Omron 705IT), and also with measurements of awake ambulatory BP (ABP, 
      SpaceLabs), in 79 subjects (36 men and 43 women) with hypertension. The mean age of 
      the study population was 56.7 +/- 11.8 years, and 33 of the subjects were not under 
      treatment for hypertension. RESULTS: The average arm-HBP was higher than the average 
      wrist-HBP (mean difference, systolic 5.2 +/- 9.1 mm Hg, P < 0.001, and diastolic 2.2 
      +/- 6.7, P < 0.01). Twenty-seven subjects (34%) had a > or =10 mm Hg difference 
      between systolic wrist-HBP and arm-HBP and twelve subjects (15%) showed similar 
      levels of disparity in diastolic HBP readings. Strong correlations were found 
      between arm-HBP and wrist-HBP (r 0.74/0.74, systolic/diastolic, P < 0.0001). 
      However, ABP was more strongly correlated with arm-HBP (r 0.73/0.76) than with 
      wrist-HBP (0.55/0.69). The wrist-arm HBP difference was associated with systolic ABP 
      (r 0.34) and pulse pressure (r 0.29), but not with diastolic ABP, sex, age, arm 
      circumference, and wrist circumference. CONCLUSIONS: There might be important 
      differences in HBP measured using validated wrist devices with position sensor vs. 
      arm devices, and these could impact decisions relating to the patient in clinical 
      practice. Measurements taken using arm devices are more closely related to ABP 
      values than those recorded by wrist devices. More research is needed before 
      recommending the widespread use of wrist monitors in clinical practice. American

TI  - Application of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in differentiating between 
      antihypertensive agents.
PG  - 181-7
AB  - PURPOSE: This multicenter, double-blind, parallel group study assessed the 
      usefulness of the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) technique in 
      differentiating between the once-daily administration of the beta blockers 
      bisoprolol (10 to 20 mg) and atenolol (50 to 100 mg) in terms of efficacy and 
      duration of action. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 659 
      patients with essential hypertension and an average office diastolic blood pressure 
      (BP) between 95 and 115 mm Hg after 4 weeks of placebo treatment. Office BPs were 
      recorded at the end of the 24-hour dosing interval (trough). ABPM was performed in 
      11 of the 28 institutions participating in this study in a total of 203 patients. 
      These procedures were performed at the end of the placebo phase and again after 8 
      weeks of active treatment. RESULTS: With the use of conventionally measured office 
      BPs, the two drugs significantly (p < 0.001) decreased trough systolic and diastolic 
      BPs to a similar extent. By 24-hour monitoring, bisoprolol demonstrated a 33% 
      greater reduction in whole-day average diastolic BP than did atenolol (11.6 +/- 0.7 
      mm Hg versus 8.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, p < 0.01). Significant treatment differences in 
      systolic (p < 0.05) and diastolic (p < 0.01) BPs were also noted for bisoprolol 
      compared with atenolol during the final 4 hours of the dosing interval (-13.2 +/- 
      1.5/-10.9 +/- 1.0 mm Hg versus -8.9 +/- 1.6/-7.3 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, respectively), and 
      over the time period 6:00 AM to noon (-14.2 +/- 1.3/-11.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg versus -9.9 
      +/- 1.4/-7.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS: Whereas conventional BP measurements did 
      not detect differences in the antihypertensive effects of the beta blockers 
      bisoprolol and atenolol, ABPM revealed significant treatment differences in both the 
      efficacy and duration of action of these two agents. These findings indicate the 
      power of this technique to discriminate potentially important differences between 
      apparently similar antihypertensive drugs.

      placebo period, 240 white patients with a mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure of 
      > or = 90 mm Hg were randomized to receive either placebo, nebivolol (1, 5, or 10 
      mg), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 or 25 mg), or one of the six possible combinations of 
      nebivolol and hydrochlorothiazide for 12 weeks. A dose-related reduction in clinic 
      and ambulatory blood pressure was demonstrated for each drug as monotherapy and for 
      the two drugs in combination. Nebivolol, 5- and 10-mg doses, showed a larger effect 
      than hydrochlorothiazide doses on clinic blood pressure and over the 24-h interval. 
      Moreover, the combination doses had substantial antihypertensive effects that were 
      sustained over the entire 24-h profile with a greater effect observed with the 
      higher dose combinations. The reduction in ambulatory blood pressure was further 
      substantiated by the reduction of blood pressure loads (% of BP > 140/90 mm Hg awake 
      and > 120/80 mm Hg asleep) to as low as 11.5% with 10 mg of nebivolol combined with 
      25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Nebivolol and hydrochlorothiazide were well tolerated. 
      We provided evidence that nebivolol, given as monotherapy or in combination with low 
      dose of hydrochlorothiazide, is effective in reducing clinic and 24-h ambulatory 
      blood pressure in patients with ambulatory hypertension. The results provided 
      further evidence for the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and factorial 
      designs when investigating new antihypertensive agents.

TI  - Underestimation of sensorimotor task-induced blood-pressure changes by posttask 
      sphygmomanometry.
PG  - 483-90
AB  - For assessment of cardiovascular effects of sensorimotor work, blood pressure is 
      commonly measured by arm sphygmomanometry. A technique introduced by Penaz makes it 
      feasible to monitor blood pressure noninvasively and continuously from the finger 
      artery which measures give high correlations with intraarterial measurement. This 
      study compared blood-pressure changes induced by a standard sensorimotor task using 
      sphygmomanometry and the Penaz-method. It was investigated whether 
      sphygmomanometrically recorded blood pressure can be used to estimate task-induced 
      blood-pressure changes and whether inflating the cuff to different maximum pressures 
      induces blood-pressure changes. 46 normotensive individuals were randomly assigned 
      to the discomfort group (maximum arm-cuff pressure of 280 mmHg) or to the control 
      group (maximum arm-cuff pressure of 160 mmHg). The experiment consisted of six tasks 
      of 4 min. each. Results indicated that sphygmomanometries under-estimated 
      task-induced blood-pressure changes and that phasic systolic and diastolic 
      blood-pressure elevations during the task were leveled off shortly after the end of 
      the task. Effects of 'cuff-inflation hypertension' were not found. The Penaz-method 
      appears to be more appropriate than sphygmomanometry if dynamic aspects of blood 
      pressure are of interest.

TI  - [The effects of enalapril on basal arterial pressure at rest and during exercise and 
      on cardiac performance in hypertensive athletes].
PG  - 935-9
AB  - A dose of 10 mg of enalapril was administered once a day to regularly trained 
      hypertensive athletes (mean age 39 +/- 8.9 range 29-51) in order to evaluate the 
      effect of the drug on ambulatory blood pressure and on blood pressure and physical 
      performance during stress testing. STUDY DESIGN. This investigation was a 
      randomized, double blind, cross-over versus placebo trial. At first, subjects whose 
      blood pressure met the entry criteria (casual diastolic blood pressure greater than 
      or equal to 95 mmHg), were subjected to 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 
      and maximal upright bicycle stress testing including measurement of O2 uptake. Then 
      they were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or enalapril. After one month 
      they repeated stress testing and then they were crossed over. Stress testing was 
      repeated in all subjects after two months. The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure 
      monitoring was repeated in all subjects during enalapril treatment only, by a 
      non-blind investigator. RESULTS. Ambulatory blood pressure decreased significantly 
      during enalapril and no changes in heart rate were observed during the monitoring. 
      The results of bicycle stress testing, both in basal and during the placebo test 
      were comparable as regards blood pressure response, maximal workload, effort 
      duration, maximal heart rate and VO2 max. With enalapril systolic and diastolic 
      blood pressure decreased significantly during stress testing both versus basal test 
      and placebo test at each workload considered including maximal workload. No changes 
      were observed during enalapril as regards maximal workload, effort duration, maximal 
      heart rate and VO2 max. CONCLUSION. Our results suggest that enalapril could be 
      effective in treating hypertensive athletes because it reduces blood pressure during 
      physical effort without affecting physical performance. We conclude that enalapril 
      could be considered a first-choice drug in hypertensive athletes doing aerobic 
      sports.

TI  - [A comparative study of the effects of lisinopril and quinapril administered once a 
      day in essential hypertension].
PG  - 541-6
AB  - The aim of the study was to compare efficacy and safety of quinapril and lisinopril 
      once-daily administered in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After a 
      two-week placebo period, 23 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure between 
      95 and 110 mmHg were randomly assigned to the therapy with quinapril 20 mg/die or 
      lisinopril 10 mg/die for 4 weeks in a single-blind design. After 4 weeks patients 
      with diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg were treated with a higher dose 
      (lisinopril 20 mg/die; quinapril 40 mg/die). Therapy with lisinopril normalized 83% 
      of patients, and quinapril 45% of patients. Lisinopril was significantly better than 
      quinapril in reducing blood pressure after 4 and 8 weeks of active treatment. The 24 
      hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed that quinapril failed to control 
      blood pressure after 12 hours from the administration of the drug.

TI  - [Comparative efficacy of sustained release verapamil and captopril in mild to 
      moderate arterial hypertension by ambulatory measurement and occasional 
      measurement].
PG  - 567-70
AB  - The evaluation of mild to moderate hypertension must be carried out under the 
      conditions in which treatments are usually prescribed, i.e., in general practice. 
      After specific training of the physicians in the methods used, we evaluated the 
      efficacy and safety of a new formulation of verapamil by comparing it with a 
      reference drug: captopril. The main assessment criterion was the restoration of 
      normal blood pressure in mildly to moderately hypertensive patients (blood pressure 
      in excess of 160/95 mmHg). Blood pressure was evaluated by two methods: a mercury 
      column sphygmomanometer, after the patient had rested in a half-sitting position for 
      10 minutes, and the ambulatory measurement of blood pressure (AMBP) using the 
      SpaceLabs system. The results of this study involving 40 patients followed up for 3 
      months by 8 GPs in collaboration with our blood pressure unit were as follows: on 
      verapamil, 47% of patients recovered normal values after 30 days of treatment and 
      71% after 60 days (with no change in dosage). On captopril, the normalization rates 
      were 22 and 27% respectively. The highly significant reduction of blood pressure 
      found by the "occasional" measurement for both treatments (p less than 0.001) was 
      only faintly reflected by AMBP. Verapamil induced a reduction of nighttime blood 
      pressure with no significant impact on heart rate. The clinical, paraclinical and 
      electrocardiographic safety of both treatments was good.

TI  - Comparing compliance patterns between randomized treatments.
PG  - 187-203
AB  - When two equally efficacious drugs enter the market, the one with the better 
      compliance is likely to be more widely used. Special management of the delivery may 
      produce increased compliance. In this paper we analyze a trial of a single drug 
      dosing prescription with patients randomized to either daily self monitoring of the 
      outcome (blood pressure) or not. The study used Medication Event Monitoring Systems 
      (MEMS) to record each exact time and date when a patient opened the pill container. 
      No established method is available for comparing these high-dimensional compliance 
      patterns between groups. This paper investigates several summary measures that 
      highlight different dimensions of the pattern and the drug context in which they may 
      be meaningful. Further, we examine conditional and marginal models that enable 
      comparisons of the full pattern of daily dosing indicators for subjects between the 
      groups. We found no simple difference in average compliance levels, but we found an 
      interesting interaction between treatment and time: similar compliance existed 
      initially among patients in both randomized groups, with a stronger decline over 
      time for patients who did not monitor their blood pressure. We discuss how a balance 
      between simplicity of interpretation and efficiency of data use may be sought in 
      this case.

TI  - Cardiovascular responses to stress in young hypertensive women.
PG  - 861-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the haemodynamic effects of 
      hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle in 11 hypertensive women aged between 29 
      and 38 years. DESIGN: In randomized order, the subjects were examined on days 2-7 
      (follicular phase) and on days 20-24 (luteal phase). All medication was withdrawn on 
      average 5 weeks prior to the experiment. The results in the hypertensive group were 
      compared with those of a control group consisting of 11 normotensive women aged 
      between 21 and 46 years who had earlier taken part in an identical experiment. 
      METHODS: A standardized mental stress test and a 24-h ambulatory blood pressure and 
      heart rate recording were performed. RESULTS. Prestress resting heart rate was 
      significantly higher in the hypertensive group and a significant difference was 
      maintained throughout the entire stress experiment. Heart rate, systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressure increased highly significantly in both groups during the 
      exposure to mental stress, but no difference in heart rate or blood pressure 
      reactivity between the normotensive and hypertensive groups was found in either 
      phase. Heart rate reactivity did not differ during the two phases in the 
      hypertensive group, in contrast to our previous findings in normotensives. During 
      24-h ambulatory recording both groups had slightly but significantly higher heart 
      rate and systolic blood pressure in the luteal phase. In the hypertensives the 
      diastolic blood pressure was also higher in this phase. Both groups had 
      significantly higher serum oestradiol and progesterone levels in the luteal phase. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study support the hypothesis that female 
      sex hormones affect cardiovascular control in both normotensive and hypertensive 
      women.

TI  - Screening for eligibility in the study of antihypertensive medication in children: 
      experience from the Ziac Pediatric Hypertension Study.
PG  - 783-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The FDA Modernization Act has resulted in an increase in pediatric 
      trials of antihypertensive medications. As experience is limited in children to 
      guide the planning of these studies, we reviewed data from the Ziac Pediatric 
      Hypertension Study to determine patterns of early study termination to help future 
      studies. METHODS: For inclusion, subjects aged 6 to 17 years were required to have 
      an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) above the 
      95th percentile at the last of three visits during 2 weeks of single-blind placebo 
      screening. Early study termination was defined as early termination for any reason. 
      Screening termination was defined as normalization of blood pressure (BP) during the 
      placebo screening phase. RESULTS: Early study termination rate was 27% (38 of 140 
      subjects). The most common reason was screening termination due to normalization of 
      BP, accounting for 63% of all early study terminations. Among screening termination 
      subjects who completed three screening visits, SBP was higher (P < .001) at visit 1 
      (129+/-8 mm Hg) than at visit 2 (123+/-7 mm Hg) or visit 3 (121+/-8 mm Hg), but did 
      not differ between visits 2 and 3. Screening termination occurred in 15% with 
      isolated SBP hypertension, and 21% with isolated DBP hypertension. At randomization, 
      83% had SBP hypertension and 53% had DBP hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: These data 
      suggest that SBP hypertension should be part of inclusion criteria to increase 
      enrollment and reduce the rate of screening termination, and that 1-week placebo 
      screening is necessary and sufficient to minimize inclusion of transiently 
      hypertensive subjects.

TI  - Application of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to clinical therapeutic 
      decisions in hypertension.
PG  - S21-5
AB  - The antihypertensive efficacies of lisinopril and captopril were compared using 
      office sphygmomanometry and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. In a 
      double-blind, prospective, randomly allocated trial, the patients were given 
      increasing doses of captopril at 25-100 mg twice a day or lisinopril at 10-40 mg 
      once a day until a clinical response was achieved or the highest dose was reached. A 
      response was defined as a reduction in diastolic pressure below 90 mmHg or a fall of 
      at least 10 mmHg from baseline. The ambulatory monitoring showed that lisinopril 
      reduced blood pressure from baseline to the final value and maintained the reduction 
      to a greater degree than captopril throughout 24-h periods of observation. The 
      office measurements showed a similar trend, but the intertreatment differences did 
      not reach statistical significance. No first-dose side effects were observed with 
      either drug. Once a day lisinopril appeared to be a more effective antihypertensive 
      regimen than twice a day captopril.

TI  - [Long-term antihypertensive effect of delayed-action molsidomine].
PG  - 646-51
AB  - The long-term antihypertensive efficacy of molsidomine 8 mg bid was studied in 24 
      patients with coronary artery disease in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 
      3 weeks duration. Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure measurements were performed at days 
      1, 2, 7, 14, and 21. Sphygmomanometric measurements of blood pressure heart rate and 
      a protocol for number and time of angina pectoris attacks were also taken. Following 
      the application of molsidomine a reduction of mean 24-h systolic blood pressure of 
      14% and of mean diastolic blood pressure of 11% was observed. The duration of the 
      blood-pressure-lowering action was 7 h. After 3 weeks of treatment with 8 mg 
      molsidomine sr bid a persistent and significant reduction of systolic and diastolic 
      blood pressure was found. A similar acute and long-term effect was found by manually 
      measured blood pressures. Heart rate was unchanged under molsidomine while the 
      frequency of angina pectoris was diminished. In conclusion, a long-lasting 
      antihypertensive efficacy (without signs of tolerance) was found over a 3-week 
      period of treatment with 8 mg molsidomine in a slow-release formulation given twice 
      a day.

TI  - Antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers administered once daily: 24-hour 
      measurements.
PG  - 166-71
AB  - Whole-day automated ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was used to assess the 
      duration of the antihypertensive actions of the beta-blockers atenolol (50 to 100 
      mg; n = 20) and acebutolol (400 to 800 mg; n = 19) each given once daily at 9 AM. 
      When compared with its pretreatment 24-hour average, atenolol decreased diastolic BP 
      by 10 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and systolic BP by 12 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 
      0.01). Acebutolol decreased the 24-hour diastolic BP by 11 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 
      0.01) and systolic BP by 13 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). More specifically, a 
      comparison of the two drugs during the final 6 hours (3 AM to 9 AM) of the dosing 
      interval showed that the mean decrease in diastolic BP of 10.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg with 
      acebutolol was greater (p less than 0.05) than the decrease of 6.2 +/- 1.3 mm Hg 
      with atenolol. Moreover, this final 6-hour effect of atenolol was less (p less than 
      0.01) than that observed during the first 18 hours of the day. The late effects of 
      acebutolol did not change significantly from its early effects. The two agents also 
      differed in their trough (final 2-hour decrease in diastolic BP) and peak (maximum 
      2-hour decrease in diastolic BP) effects: for atenolol the peak-to-trough difference 
      was 7.8 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), whereas for acebutolol it was 3.8 +/- 4.2 
      mm Hg (N.S.). This study confirms the efficacy of atenolol and acebutolol.(ABSTRACT

PG  - 477-84
AB  - Compliance with antihypertensive treatment can be increased by using medications 
      that are taken only once daily. There is, however, concern as to whether the 
      efficacy of such drugs is sufficient to cover 24 h. Ambulatory blood pressure 
      monitoring (ABPM) is an ideal technique to assess the effect of this kind of drug 
      and to determine over- or undertreatment. In this study three drugs were examined as 
      once-a-day preparations. Thirty-six patients were treated with three different doses 
      of bisoprolol, as an example of the beta 1-selective beta-blockers; 12 patients were 
      treated with a combination of the AChE-inhibitor enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide; 
      eight patients were treated with nifedipine once per day, a new galenic form of 
      nifedipine, as an example of the calcium-channel blockers. In each group we saw a 
      significant downward shift over the entire 24-h curve. Our results also show that 
      using 24-h blood pressure monitoring devices can help establish an appropriate dose, 
      avoid over- and undertreatment, and control the total burden of the patient.

      Verapamil Study Group.
PG  - 375-80
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel delivery system of physiologic 
      pattern release (PPR)-verapamil administered nocturnally to patients with stages I 
      and II hypertension using ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, we performed a 
      multicenter (17 centers), double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
      parallel-group trial with placebo and 120, 180, 360, and 540 mg of verapamil in 287 
      randomized patients. The delivery system has a delay in the release of verapamil for 
      4 to 6 hours, and then delivers the drug from an osmotic pumping system for 
      approximately 12 hours. Patients were dosed at 10 P.M. The primary end point was 
      change from baseline in trough diastolic BP assessed by ambulatory BP monitoring 
      from 6 to 10 P.M. after 8 weeks of therapy, whereas secondary measures included 
      changes from baseline in peak, early morning (6 to 10 A.M.) systolic and diastolic 
      BP, trough clinic BP, and 24-hour average daytime (8 A.M. to 8 P.M.) and nighttime 
      (8 P.M. to 8 A.M.) BP. The 180, 360, and 540 mg verapamil doses achieved 
      statistically significant reductions in trough (6 to 10 P.M.) diastolic BP (-3.9 +/- 
      1.0, -7.8 +/- 1.2, and -10.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, respectively). Reductions in peak early 
      morning (6 to 10 A.M.) diastolic BP were greater (-4.6 +/- 0.9, -13.3 +/- 1.2, and 
      -19.0 +/- 1.2, for 180, 360, and 540 mg, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Effect of nisoldipine on ambulatory blood pressure under 24-hour noninvasive 
      monitoring.
PG  - 688-93
AB  - The antihypertensive effect of nisoldipine on ambulatory blood pressure was 
      investigated using continuous noninvasive monitoring in 12 patients with moderate 
      essential hypertension. Treatment with nisoldipine 5 mg twice a day for 2 weeks 
      resulted in a decrease in the average of each patient's mean arterial pressure for 
      the whole day from 110.3 +/- 6.8 to 103.2 +/- 8.8 mm Hg (P = 0.0007). This decrease 
      in mean arterial pressure was due to a decrease in both systolic and diastolic 
      pressures. The reduction in blood pressure was most marked at the time of the 
      originally high blood pressure readings. Comparisons of consecutive means of 
      2-hourly mean arterial pressure readings showed a statistically significant effect 
      from 6:00 AM to midnight. Blood pressures between midnight and 6:00 AM were 
      similarly low, before and during nisoldipine therapy. There was no change in heart 
      rate. Untoward symptoms were reported with similar frequency, and of similar 
      severity, both before and during therapy. Nisoldipine 5 mg twice a day is an 
      effective antihypertensive agent, reducing moderately elevated blood pressure in 
      ambulatory, working patients with essential hypertension. At the dosage used, it had 
      no demonstrable effect on heart rate and minimal, if any, side effects.

TI  - Intra-arterial monitoring of the antihypertensive effects of once-daily amlodipine.
PG  - S9-12
AB  - Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a long elimination half life 
      making it suitable for once-daily dosing. This study used sphygmomanometric and 
      intra-arterial ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring to confirm the 
      antihypertensive effect of a once-daily dose of amlodipine over the dosing interval. 
      After a 2-week single-blind placebo run in, amlodipine was administered to 11 
      patients at a starting dose of 5 mg daily for 2 weeks increasing to 10 mg daily for 
      a further 4 weeks if diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured sphygmomanometrically 
      was not < 90 mmHg or decreased by > 10 mmHg from baseline values. Intra-arterial 
      blood pressure recordings for 24-hour periods were made at the end of the placebo 
      run in and on completion of the active treatment phase. The effects of isometric and 
      dynamic exercise and head-up tilting (60 degrees) on BP and heart rate were measured 
      during ambulatory monitoring. Mean supine cuff BP was 169/104 mmHg (n = 11) at the 
      end of the placebo treatment period and was reduced to 153/95 mmHg (n = 11) after 2 
      weeks of amlodipine treatment and 146/92 mmHg (n = 11) after 6 weeks of amlodipine 
      treatment. There was no significant change in heart rate. Intra-arterial ambulatory 
      monitoring showed that BP was controlled for the whole dosing interval with 
      once-daily doses of amlodipine. The normal circadian pattern of BP changes was not 
      altered. BP was reduced by amlodipine during exercise and physiological tests, but 
      there was no postural hypotension and the BP and heart rate responses to exercise 
      were not blunted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Casual versus ambulatory twenty-four-hour blood pressure measurement in a 
      comparative study with bisoprolol or nitrendipine.
PG  - S91-4
AB  - In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomly allocated study, the 24-h efficacy 
      of a single morning dose of 10 mg of the beta-blocker bisoprolol (n = 17) versus 20 
      mg of the calcium channel antagonist nitrendipine (n = 19) was assessed using two 
      different methods of blood pressure determination: (1) casual blood pressure 
      determinations in the morning before the dose; and (2) ambulatory day-time (6 a.m. 
      to 6 p.m.) and night-time (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) blood pressure monitoring using a 
      non-invasive automatic device (Spacelabs 90202). After 4 weeks both agents induced 
      significant blood pressure reductions compared to the placebo period as assessed by 
      both casual and ambulatory day-time readings, without significant differences in the 
      blood pressure reductions induced by the two drugs (P less than 0.05). Ambulatory 
      night-time values, however, showed a significant blood pressure reduction only for 
      bisoprolol (from 138 +/- 16/84 +/- 12 to 129 +/- 15/77 +/- 11 mmHg); nitrendipine 
      did not induce any significant systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes during 
      this period (140 +/- 11/87 +/- 10 to 136 +/- 13/86 +/- 10 mmHg). Individual response 
      rates were 47% for nitrendipine and 71% for bisoprolol. The incidence of side 
      effects was comparable under both drugs. Our results indicate that bisoprolol was 
      more effective over 24 h than nitrendipine. We also conclude that the value of 
      casual blood pressure readings for the evaluation of therapeutic agents given once a 
      day seems to be limited in comparison to 24-h ambulatory monitoring.

TI  - The contribution of ambulatory blood pressure measurement to the evaluation of new 
      antihypertensive drugs.
PG  - S54-6
AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure recording can provide information on blood pressure 
      changes throughout the day and night and during normal daily activities. The former 
      features are of particular use in evaluating the duration of action and 
      dose-response relationships for new antihypertensive drugs, especially those 
      developed for once daily dosing. Improved precision and multiple measurements 
      through the dose interval may reduce the number of patients required in trials. We 
      have recently used ambulatory blood pressure recording to assess the magnitude and 
      duration of the first dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, 
      quinapril, compared to placebo. In addition, the effects on blood pressure of 
      long-acting calcium antagonists, alone and in combination, have been measured. 
      Ambulatory blood pressure recording can complement conventional approaches in 
      determining the dose range, frequency of administration and concentration-effect 
      relationships of new and existing antihypertensive drugs.

TI  - Double-blind, randomized comparative study of the antihypertensive effect of 
      nicardipine slow-release and nifedipine slow-release in hypertensive patients with 
      coronary heart disease.
PG  - 647-54
AB  - The main aim of this study was to investigate whether a new slow-release formation 
      of nicardipine can control hypertension and whether its antihypertensive effect is 
      manifest throughout the dose intervals. In a randomized, double-blind 
      placebo-controlled study, the antihypertensive effect of two calcium antagonists 
      (Type II) was investigated in two independent groups of hypertensive patients with 
      coronary artery disease. One group of patients received 40 mg nicardipine 
      slow-release b.i.d. and the other 20 mg nifedipine slow-release b.i.d. The effect of 
      the active drugs on blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and hemodynamics was compared 
      with placebo within each group. In addition, a group comparison was made to 
      establish whether nicardipine had any advantage over nifedipine. Twenty-eight 
      patients [27 female, 1 male; 55 (41-72) years old], 18 with previous myocardial 
      infarction (MI) entered the study (nicardipine, 15 patients; nifedipine, 13 
      patients). A placebo period of 3 days was followed by a 13-day drug treatment 
      period. From the first to last trial day, BP and heart rate were measured three 
      times daily. At the end of the placebo and the active drug periods, the following 
      measurements were carried out: ambulatory BP monitoring by half-hourly recording for 
      12.5 hours with the Remler system, ergometric tests with ECG, and right heart 
      catheterization. Both drugs lowered the BP at rest, during exercise, and during 
      usual daily activities. The antihypertensive effect of nicardipine was significant 
      for the daytime mean arterial BP (MAP) and for systolic BP and diastolic BP at 
      various stages of the exercise tests. The difference between the effect of 
      nicardipine and nifedipine was not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 804-10
AB  - Large artery properties constitute an important component of left ventricular 
      afterload in hypertension. The present study examined whether such properties were 
      particularly responsive to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. A 
      prospective, randomized, 12-week study in 138 previously treated hypertensive 
      subjects, in 67 of whom usual treatment (UC) was replaced with perindopril (P) 
      therapy. Large artery properties were assessed as central arterial pressure 
      augmentation determined by applanation tonometry of the radial artery and a transfer 
      function. At baseline both augmentation index (AI, %) and pressure (AP, mm Hg) were 
      related to body size, heart rate, and gender. In addition AP was related to age and 
      systolic blood pressure (BP). After 12 weeks of treatment AP decreased significantly 
      in both perindopril and UC groups, whereas AI only decreased significantly 
      (151.7%+/-2.3% to 144.9%+/-2.6%) in those treated with perindopril. Decreases in AP 
      (-4.2+/-0.9 mm Hg v -1.9+/-0.7 mm Hg) and AI (-6.8%+/-2.2% v -2.2%+/-2.5%) from week 
      0 to week 12 were greater in the perindopril-treated group, but differences between 
      groups failed to reach statistical significance (P = .05 and .09, respectively). The 
      change in AI during the 12-week treatment period was dependent on the initial heart 
      rate (P < .001), systolic BP (P < .05), weight (P < .001), and sex (P < .001), but 
      not on treatment group (P > .5). Al at 12 weeks was negatively correlated with heart 
      rate but regression slopes for the association were virtually identical for 
      perindopril and UC groups. Perindopril treatment produces a greater decrease in AI 
      than continuation with previous therapy, but this can be largely explained by 
      hemodynamic changes rather than direct arterial effects.

TI  - Crossover comparison of atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide and isradipine for 
      isolated systolic systemic hypertension.
PG  - 1299-305
AB  - The benefit of antihypertensive therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality associated with isolated systolic hypertension has now been established by 
      the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program. However, there is little 
      information about the relative effectiveness of different drug regimens in this 
      condition. This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of 50 mg of atenolol, 
      10 mg of enalapril, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 2.5 mg of isradipine in the 
      treatment of isolated systolic hypertension. After a 3-week placebo run-in phase, 24 
      subjects were randomized into a 4-period double-blind crossover study by use of an 
      orthogonal latin square design. Treatment periods were of 6 weeks' duration with 
      titration to a higher dose after 4 weeks in those not reaching goal blood pressure 
      (BP). Each active treatment was followed by a 3-week placebo washout. Casual clinic 
      and 24-hour ambulatory BP (Accutracker II) were measured at the end of each 
      treatment phase. Routine biochemistry was also performed after the placebo run-in, 
      at the end of each active treatment phase, and after the placebo run-out. Of the 24 
      subjects entered (mean age 72.3 years, 38% men) 20 completed the whole study. Mean 
      +/- standard deviation of supine clinic and daytime ambulatory BP on entry were 
      181/79 +/- 21/9 mm Hg and 165/82 +/- 23/15 mm Hg, respectively. All drugs reduced 
      mean casual and ambulatory BP significantly relative to placebo but only 
      hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril produced a consistent hypotensive effect 
      throughout the entire 24-hour period. Isradipine and enalapril exhibited a 
      relatively greater effect on reducing systolic BP than either hydrochlorothiazide or 
      atenolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      inside or outside the hospital?].
PG  - 911-7
AB  - To investigate whether hospitalization may influence the circadian rhythm of blood 
      pressure (BP), 15 untreated patients with essential hypertension underwent 
      noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring twice, at home and in the hospital, 
      in a random order, 11 days apart. During the hospital session, which took place on 
      the ninth day of hospitalization, patients were allowed to move freely in the 
      hospital area, to receive visits by friends and relatives and to engage in social 
      activities with other inpatients. Home sessions were performed during a usual 
      working day in 14 of 15 patients. Average 24-hour systolic/diastolic BP was 151/93 
      mmHg (DS 19/10) at home and 154/93 mmHg (DS 21/7) in the hospital; average daytime 
      (6am-10pm) values were 155/97 mmHg (DS 19/10) at home and 157/96 mmHg (DS 20/5) in 
      the hospital; average night-time (10pm-6am) values were 146/88 mmHg (DS 21/12) at 
      home and 150/89 mmHg (DS 23/10). These values did not show any statistical 
      differences (analysis of variance) due to status (home vs hospital), period or 
      sequence. The hourly BP averages of the hospital recording did not differ 
      significantly from the corresponding averages of the home recording. The correlation 
      between hospital and home 24-hour averages of systolic and diastolic BP was close (r 
      = 0.87 and r = 0.78, respectively; p less than 0.01). The chronobiological analysis 
      (single cosinor) showed a statistically significant circadian rhythm of systolic BP 
      in 10/15 patients at home and in 8/15 patients in the hospital (p = NS), and a 
      statistically significant rhythm of diastolic BP in 9/15 patients at home and in 
      10/15 patients in the hospital (p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Effects of antihypertensive therapy with lacidipine on ambulatory blood pressure in 
      the elderly.
PG  - S79-83
AB  - Recent multicenter trials have demonstrated that, in hypertensive elderly people, 
      blood pressure control can significantly decrease the rate of cardiovascular and 
      cerebrovascular events. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has 
      proved to be superior to isolated sphygmomanometer blood pressure readings in the 
      diagnostic evaluation of hypertension and in assessing the blood pressure response 
      to treatment. We used 24-h ambulatory monitoring in a small, double-blind, 
      randomly-allocated, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of antihypertensive 
      treatment with lacidipine given once a day at 2 or 4 mg. In our elderly subjects, 
      the lacidipine treatment provided adequate blood pressure control both by day and by 
      night with no effect on the heart rate profile. Furthermore, after drug therapy, we 
      found a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure variability (standard 
      deviation). This study shows that lacidipine can provide adequate control of 
      arterial hypertension in the elderly.

TI  - Antihypertensive effect of isradipine administered once or twice daily on ambulatory 
      blood pressure.
PG  - 467-72
AB  - The antihypertensive efficacy of sustained-release isradipine administered once 
      daily compared to the immediate-release formulation administered twice daily was 
      assessed by ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring in a double-blind randomized 
      crossover study in 76 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients. Conventional BP and 
      heart rate parameters were evaluated after a 4-week placebo period and patients 
      qualified for entry if sitting diastolic BP was between 95 and 114 mm Hg. Ambulatory 
      BP monitoring was measured at baseline and after active treatment with both 
      formulations. The 2 regimens induced a significant and almost identical reduction (p 
      less than 0.001) in the mean 24-hour BP without affecting heart rate. Isradipine was 
      more effective in patients whose clinical hypertension was confirmed by ambulatory 
      BP monitoring (35) than in patients who remained normotensive by ambulatory BP 
      monitoring criteria (41). The isradipine-treated ambulatory hypertensive group 
      experienced significantly greater decreases in BP during 24-hour, work, awake and 
      sleep periods than did the ambulatory normotensive group. These data suggest that 
      sustained-release isradipine has a sustained antihypertensive effect throughout 24 
      hours comparable to that of isradipine given twice daily and may improve compliance 
      with long-term treatment. In addition, the results confirm the usefulness of 
      ambulatory BP monitoring in determining truly hypertensive patients likely to 
      respond to drug administration.

TI  - The effect of placebo on indirect and direct blood pressure measurements.
PG  - S93-100
AB  - We have conducted a series of experiments which clearly show that intra-arterial 
      ambulatory blood pressure is not altered by the administration of placebo. This 
      finding is in contrast to the apparent fall in pressure that appears when the 
      indirect (Korotkoff) method is used. The evidence suggests that the apparent fall in 
      indirect pressure is due to abolition of the orienting reflex with time. Therefore, 
      clinical trials of antihypertensive drugs using the intra-arterial method do not 
      need a placebo control, whereas a placebo control is essential in all trials using 
      the indirect technique for measuring blood pressure.

PG  - 1665-82
AB  - We propose the use of Gaussian mixed models to analyse statistically 24 hour 
      ambulatory blood pressure data from clinical trials. We develop specific models and 
      apply them to data from a clinical study that compares two angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme inhibitors. We investigate and discuss computing issues related to the 
      implementation of such methods. We conclude that this methodology provides a 
      sophisticated but practical approach to the analysis of such data.

      stress].
PG  - 533-9
AB  - Thirty-six patients (17 males and 19 females), aged between 40 and 70 years old 
      (mean age 55.9), suffering from slight or moderate arterial hypertension, were 
      monitored for four weeks after 14 days of placebo treatment. In a double-blind and 
      random study 24 patients were treated with Nicardipine Retard (40 mg twice a day) 
      whereas a further 12 received placebo twice a day. Sphigomanometric controls carried 
      out after two and four weeks showed a significant reduction in arterial pressure 
      only in those patients receiving active treatment. 24-hour out-patient monitoring of 
      arterial pressure, carried out using Spacelabs 5300, showed a reduction in both 
      systolic and diastolic arterial pressure throughout the day in subjects treated with 
      calcium-antagonists compared to the placebo group. The normal physiological 24-hour 
      trend of arterial pressure was always taken into account. The pressure response to a 
      cold pressor test, mental arithmetic test, isometric and dynamic effort tests, 
      measuring using a cycloergometer, was not modified by anti-hypertensive treatment, 
      thus confirming the preservation of normal physiological behaviour during daily 
      activities. There was no significant change in heart rate and the drug was well 
      tolerated.

PG  - S131-3
AB  - The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril was evaluated using 24-h noninvasive 
      ambulatory sphygmomanometry in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study. One 
      hundred subjects with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were randomized to 
      ramipril, 10 mg or placebo once daily for a 4-week treatment period. Ramipril 
      decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressures throughout the 24-h period after 
      dosing. Blood pressures measured manually 24 h postdose also showed that ramipril 
      significantly reduced supine and standing blood pressures when compared with 
      placebo. Incidences of adverse events were similar in the two study groups. Ramipril 
      proved to be a well-tolerated agent with a sustained 24-h antihypertensive effect in 
      this study.

TI  - Antihypertensive effect of carvedilol: a preliminary dose-response study.
PG  - S37-8
AB  - The blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of low doses of antihypertensive agents is 
      not usually explored because of the difficulty in detecting small changes in BP. 
      Since ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in a cross-over trial design can reliably 
      detect differences of 5 mmHg with less than 20 subjects, we have used this technique 
      to assess the dose-response curve of a new beta-blocker, carvedilol. Twenty subjects 
      were enrolled after diagnostic ambulatory BP monitoring had shown a day-time average 
      diastolic BP of over 90 mmHg. Three doses of carvedilol (6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg daily) 
      and placebo were then given double-blind in random order for periods of 4 weeks 
      each. No period effects were detected. The antihypertensive effect was statistically 
      significant at doses of 12.5 mg and 25 mg daily. There was, however, no evidence 
      that 25 mg/day produced the peak effect. The lowest dose (6.25 mg/day) produced a 
      small fall in both systolic and diastolic BP but neither of these were significant. 
      We conclude that doses of 12.5 and 25 mg carvedilol once a day are adequate for the 
      treatment of hypertension.

TI  - Office versus ambulatory recordings of blood pressure (OvA): a European multicenter 
      study. The Steering Committee.
PG  - S39-41
AB  - The long-term prognostic value of ambulatory blood pressure recordings in essential 
      hypertension is poorly documented. A European Multicenter study has been set up to 
      evaluate office versus ambulatory (OvA) recordings during a follow-up period of 5 
      years in a minimum of 2000 patients. The end-point of the study is the question of 
      whether ambulatory blood pressure measurements are better correlated with patient 
      morbidity and mortality than office recordings. In a specific substudy, short-term 
      evolution (6 months) of left ventricular hypertrophy will be followed in untreated 
      hypertensives with randomly allocated treatment. A number of readaptations of the 
      primary protocol are discussed.

TI  - Antihypertensive dose-response relationships: studies with the selective alpha 
      1-blocking agent terazosin.
PG  - 905-10
AB  - Terazosin is a selective alpha 1-adrenergic-blocking agent indicated for the 
      treatment of hypertension. The aim of this multicenter study, performed in 256 
      patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, was to define the dosing 
      characteristics of terazosin (in the range of 1 to 80 mg) administered once daily. 
      Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or active treatment groups; each group 
      received 3 months of treatment, which comprised three ascending doses of terazosin, 
      each administered for a 1-month period. As determined by conventional office 
      measurements of supine diastolic blood pressure and by automated ambulatory blood 
      pressure monitoring, there was a clear antihypertensive dose-response relationship 
      for terazosin in the range of 1 to 5 mg daily. Except for the 80 mg dose, none of 
      the doses above 5 mg (10 to 40 mg) appeared to provide additional efficacy. Both the 
      office measurements and the monitoring data indicated that the ratio of trough 
      (effect at the end of the dosing interval) to peak (maximum effect during the dosing 
      interval) was at least 50% or greater during treatment with the 5 mg dose. Thus the 
      5 mg dose appeared to provide meaningful clinical antihypertensive efficacy and to 
      sustain its effects throughout the full 24-hour period.
